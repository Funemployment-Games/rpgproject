Current Tackle List
Matthew - I'm going to create a sample starter town and start setting up the code and scripting functionality for it. My first goal is multiple, unique NPCs, followed by fixed path moving NPCs, followed by shops. I also plan to finish setting it up so that the player can enter/exit the castle.
