Introduction
------------
When I saw FF2 (SNES) for the first time, I was in love with the game. I
love all the various incarnations of this game, and it's great seeing the
little differences between the versions. I wrote this FAQ because there are
many details lacking in the current spell guides for this game put up. I
commend BSiron's original FF2 (SNES) Algo FAQ for getting the basic info out
there. It lacks a few details, which my document will cover. I will also try
to dispel stupid rumors that people have regarding this game as well.

This document will cover the following versions/ports that will be referenced
in the guide:
FF2   - Final Fantasy 2 (SNES), both revisions 1.0 and 1.1
FF4   - Final Fantasy 4 (Super Famicom, - Japanese)
FF4ET - Final Fantasy 4 Easytype (Super Famicom, - Japanese)*
FF4A  - Final Fantasy 4 Advance, US and Euro versions
(matches up with Jap 1.0 and 1.1 revisions respectively)

*Note: This game is NOT FF2 in Japanese.

When I make reference to the SNES ports, I mean FF2, FF4, and FF4ET unless
a specific version is mentioned.

This info has not been tested or verified with the following versions/ports:
FF4PS - Final Fantasy 4 PSX port (from the FF Anthologies Collection)
FF4WS - Final Fantasy 4 Wonderswan port
FF4DS - Final Fantasy 4 DS port

So, not to keep you waiting too much, onto the spells!

There spells will be listed in the following format:

Name: This is self-explanatory.
Casting Time: A delay is inserted before the spell is cast. Higher values
imply a longer delay. Increasing Agility helps to reduce the impact of the
delay. There is no delay for monsters casting a spell.
MP Cost: This is self explanatory. Monsters require and consume 0 MP to
cast a spell, which implies that MP is irrelevant for them.
Status Effect: A status effect may be inflicted as part of the spell.
Elemental: When a spell is based on an elemental, the target's weakness,
resistance, or immunity can change the damage dealt. It is also possible that
the target can absorb the elemental magic attack.
Spell Power: For attack spells, this is generally applied against
Magic Defense of the target to compute the damage taken/dealt. The internal
value for most spells is Spell Power/4. The internal value for summons is
Spell Power/8.
Targeting: There are 8 different possibilities of targeting. Any spell that
always targets all opponents or all allies will avoid split damage.
Monsters casting spells tend to ignore spell targeting data and use their
battle script targeting data instead.
Hit Rate: The success of the spell is determined by this value.
Boss Bit: If set, this spell will always fail on monsters with the boss
bit set.
Solo Multiplier: If set, this spell will always have a spell multiplier
of 1 and the target will have at most a magic defense multiplier of 1.
Ignore Reflect: If true, this spell will ignore Reflect status on the target.
Notes: Any other relevant info will be provided here.


Spells (in the order they are listed internally)
------

Hold
Casting Time: 1
MP Cost: 5
Status Effect: Paralyze
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one target, default enemy
Hit Rate: 85
Boss Bit: Yes
Solo Multiplier: Yes
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: This spell's success appears to be level driven as well. This spell
will automatically fail if paralysis or other statuses that have a greater
priority are inflicted. High Will Power or monster Spell Power will reduce
the duration of the status.


Mute/Silence
Casting Time: 2
MP Cost: 6
Status Effect: Silence
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one/all targets, default one enemy
Hit Rate: 90

Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one target, default enemy
Hit Rate: 75
Boss Bit: Yes
Solo Multiplier: Yes
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: Monsters affected by Charm status will run their "Charm" scripts, which
do not guarantee them hurting themselves. Characters affected by Charm status
will either attack or cast a random White or Black magic spell, assuming the
character has that option. FF4A appears to prevent the casting of Meteor and
Holy by your characters intentionally.


Blink
Casting Time: 0
MP Cost: 8
Status Effect: Image (2)
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one target, default ally

Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: +5 Defense
Targeting: one/all targets, default one ally
Hit Rate: 66
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: Yes
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: When successful, this spell increases the afflicted target's defense
by 5, to a max of 255. The SNES version of the game visually displays spell
failure when defense is maxed. Failure of this spell can be frequent
due to low Will Power/Spirit of the caster. Multitargeting does not reduce
the power of the spell. Although this spell is "dummied out" of FF2, it is
cast by the Mind monster vs physical attacks. This is also a spell not normally
castable in FF4ET, but can be cast as a weapon-item via the Defender and
Murasame. The spell is also cast by Endure/Gird, which follows the same rules
as the spell, except that in FF4A, the enemy does not benefit when the spell
is reflected. The Protect bonus is not applied in the Zeromus battle, even
though the animation shows success and Zeromus never makes a physical attack.


Shell

Notes: When successful, this spell increases the afflicted target's magic
defense by 3, to a max of 255. The SNES version of the game visually displays
spell failure when magic defense is maxed. Failure of this spell can be
frequent due to Will Power/Spirit of the caster. Multitargeting does not
reduce the power of the spell. Although this spell is "dummied out" of FF2,
it is cast by the Mind monster vs Holy elemental magic. This is also a spell
not normally castable in FF4ET, but can be cast as a weapon-item via the
Elven Bow. The Shell bonus is not applied in the Zeromus battle, even though
the animation shows success.


Slow
Casting Time: 1
MP Cost: 14
Status Effect: n/a
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: +8 Speed Modifier
Targeting: one/all targets, default one enemy
Hit Rate: 70
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: The default speed modifier is 16 for all targets.

at 32. At 32, the target's ATB is twice as slow. This spell slows down every
timer, except for Count/Doom.


Fast/Haste
Casting Time: 1
MP Cost: 25
Status Effect: n/a
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: -3 Speed Modifier
Targeting: one target, default ally
Hit Rate: 50
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: The default speed modifier is 16 for all targets.
Haste decreases this modifier by 3 points. The lowest this modifier can be is
at 12. At 12, the target's ATB seems to increase by 25%. This spell quickens
every timer, except for Count/Doom. Monsters targeting characters with this
spell is treated negatively and is blocked by magic defense.

physical attacks to random enemy targets.

Status Effect: Wall/Reflect
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one target, default ally
Hit Rate: 75
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: In the SNES version, reflecting a spell causes the monster's 
magic counter script to be avoided. For instance, a Behemoth doesn't react
to Holy when it is reflected. Also, certain spell palettes are modified
when reflected in the SNES version. In FF4A, the Wicked Mask's Reflect
always succeeds unlike the SNES version. For magic in general, all spells that
are cast towards the enemy and is considered a negative attack and magic
evasion is tested against. You will find that the EvilMask's Reflect can fail
to be applied in the SNES versions, hence the change made in FF4A.


White/Holy
Casting Time: 3 (2 in FF4ET)
MP Cost: 46
Status Effect: HP Leak (if the target is weak vs the elemental)

Targeting: one target, default enemy
Hit Rate: 70
Boss Bit: Yes
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: In the SNES version, this spell cannot remove Stop status, but ends
its timer for characters, which freezes them indefinitely until Stop status is
reapplied. This spell is dummied out of FF2 for some unknown reason. This is
also a spell not normally castable in FF4ET, but can be cast as a weapon-item
via the Lunar/Energy Staff.

not Dark Wave).

Life1/Life
Casting Time: 0
MP Cost: 8
Status Effect: removes Death status
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one target, default ally
Hit Rate: 75
Boss Bit: Yes
Solo Multiplier: Yes
Ignore Reflect: No
Notes: This spell revives a target with HP = Vitality (Stamina) * 5.
It is possible for this spell to fail in battle with Tellah. There is
peculiar behavior when the Vitality/Stamina stat is 0. In the SNES version,
reviving the character outside of battle will produce a 0HP "living" character,
until battle starts and the characters reverts to death status. This character
cannot be revived in battle. In the GBA version, reviving the character outside
of battle will also produce a 0HP living character. If revived in battle, the
character will have 1HP. A 0HP character will still function normally until
damage is taken. This can be used in the SNES versions to get an extra kill
on a monster for experience/item harvesting. Since monsters don't have a
Vitality stat, they are "revived" with 0 HP, which results in another kill.
This bug cannot be exposed vs bosses or Death resistant monsters.


Life2/Full-Life

MP Cost: 52

Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a

Notes: This spell revives a target to full HP.
It is possible for this spell to fail in battle with Tellah. This can be used

bug cannot be exposed vs bosses or Death resistant monsters.

Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: one/all targets, default one enemy

Notes: The twins use this spell infrequently. MP is consumed by both twins

Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: 1 (Current HP Modifier)

Targeting: one enemy
Hit Rate: 100

Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: 1 (Current HP Modifier)
Targeting: all enemies
Hit Rate: 100
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: Yes

Status Effect: n/a
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: 120
Targeting: one enemy
Hit Rate: 100
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: Yes
Notes: The damage dealt will be converted into healing, split between all
characters on the field, minus those Hiding, Jumping, dead, or petrified.
This spell consumes 0 MP in the SNES versions. It is a bug because it is
probably considered a monster spell, which has a 0 MP consumption property.


Odin/Zantetsuken

MP Cost: 45
Status Effect: n/a
Elemental: n/a
Spell Power: n/a
Targeting: all enemies
Hit Rate: 0
Boss Bit: Yes
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: Yes
Notes: This is a spell driven primarily by the caster's Wisdom. The spell's
hit rate is derived by Wisdom/2, so the highest hit rate possible is 49%.
If you move Rydia into Slot 1 (middle slot), it should increase her chance
to 61%. This spell will automatically fail if any target has the boss bit.
When this spell succeeds, a sliced effect is used as the death animation.

graphic.

Spell Power: +5 Defense (240 base spell power for FF2)
Targeting: all allies
Hit Rate: 66 (100 for FF2)
Boss Bit: No
Solo Multiplier: No
Ignore Reflect: Yes
Notes: This is Protect, like when you fought Asura in the boss battle. FF4ET
uses the Cure3/Curaja graphic instead. FF2 uses the Cure3/Curaja graphic and
does overpowered healing (9000 max for all targets in the best case scenario).

Notes: This attack is made by the Panther/Cait Sith and Black Cat/Coeurl (and
Coeurl Regina in FF4A). The status affliction has a 1/2 distribution for Death
or Paralysis. There is an annoying behavior in FF4A which causes the effect to
be displayed, even though status resistance would normally cause it to fail
and produce no graphical effect.

Notes: This is a revised version of Double Meteor that is used by the twins
and Golbez/FuSoYa combo. It is a stronger version of Meteor due to how it is
calculated and requires less Intelligence, particularly from Porom to make
it deal 9999 damage. It requires 36 Intelligence vs a monster with 0 magic
defense and 52 Intelligence vs a monster with 254 magic defense.

Death/Fatal...)

All this work and research would not have been possible without the help of
zyrothfar's editor. It's really nifty, but as of the current moment, it's still
a bit buggy, but lots of other FF4 research and testing was accomplished
with the help of this editor.

BSiron's original FF2 Algo FAQ is the most awesome thing written for this game
and even though it's mostly obsolete in some instances, it is the basis for
so many bits and pieces that have been derived and expanded upon...

I would like to thank Dragonsbrethren for tolerating me and answered questions
I had about FF4, before I even realized there was more to the game than what
I already knew after many many many years of playing this game.

I thank Lenophis for putting up with me. :P

JCE3000GT deserves special thanks for currently putting up a fairly good
FF2 hack for this game and getting me very interested. I would say that it is
the benchmark of all FF2/4 hacks to come.

I would also like to thank Phoenix to go look into the code to find and
verify stuff that have even yet to be documented (I'll have to get around to
it).

Entroper provided some nice datasheets for FF4A.

Paladin provided a nice datasheet for FF2/4, although there was a bunch of
data that finally confirms some stuff that was never quite finished for FF2/4.

There's this Japanese site with all the cool info I'd like to thank too... but
I can't read Japanese for the life of me, so bleh.

Also, whoever wrote and/or contributed to the Tower of Bab-il documents should
be thanked for providing quite of bit of insight to the internal game engine.

Others that I can't remember off the top of my head, I thank you too!

Whoever is hosting the forum with all the info that have been dug up and
researched, I thank you too.

I also thank and blame the idiots to make stupid unfounded statements about
this game. Only you people make me furious enough to prove you wrong.

I credit myself only because I selfishly want a better FF2/4 hack. :P

Thanks to J2e for producing a decent translation for FF4, even though they
don't seem to have any idea on battle mechanics and mislabeled certain
equipment descriptions (the Avenger Sword for one).

This guide would never have been possible without your help!

Thanks to CJayC for hosting this guide on Gamefaqs.
