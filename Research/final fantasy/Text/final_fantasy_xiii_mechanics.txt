Introduction and acknowledgements
=============================================================================

The following guide is primarily meant to be a translation of the facts and
formulae present in the Final Fantasy XIII Ultimania Battle Guide. So far
I have chosen to exclude information such as the material and weapon 
crafting data due to the likelihood of redundancy with another FAQ although 
I might choose to include it in the future. 

This guide does not cover the events of the story so there should be minimal 
storyline spoilers but I will not label any potential spoilers so be warned 
that locations, names, and minor story details may very well be present in 
this FAQ.

First and foremost, I'd like to acknowledge that although the wording is 
my own translation, most of the information was obtained from the Final 
Fantasy Ultimania Battle Guide by Studio BentStuff. I'd also like to make the 
acknowledgement that the layout and formatting of this FAQ took inspiration 
from the Final Fantasy Tactics Battle Mechanics Guide by Aerostar.

IruuL          -  03/12/2010  -  Thanks for mentioning the ATB gauge reset
                                 I would have probably just skipped over it
                                 otherwise.

Porcupine      -  04/15/2010  -  Providing help on evasion and an
                                 inconsistency in the guide.

destrian522    -  06/09/2011  -  Making me realize that the information on
                                 Status Effects was incomplete.

Version History
=============================================================================
Ver 0.50 - March 7th 2010        First submitted FAQ. Still need to fill in
                                 a decent amount of the information as well 
                                 as change all of the Japanese version terms 
                                 to the English version terms.

Ver 0.70 - April 3rd 2010        Changed most of the terms to the US version
                                 equivalent. Updated a lot of information.
                                 The Chain & Stagger section is now up as
                                 well.

Ver 0.80 - April 17th 2010       Minor fixes. Sentinel and item skills are
                                 now updated. Added a new section on enemies.
                                 Added information on evasion.

Ver 0.90 - February 24th 2011    Finished up most of the sections. Plan to add
                                 information on the ability to knock enemies up
                                 into the air (Rise) at a later date. Also
                                 plan to add more enemies to the enemy list.

Ver 1.00 - May 21st 2011         For the most part, everything I wanted to list
                                 in this guide is done. The enemy list now 
                                 contains boss enemies from act 3 through 13.

Ver 1.01 - June 3rd 2011         I was having some problems resolving the 
                                 battle result calculation on high level 
                                 enemies until I realized I read the Ultimania
                                 incorrectly. Enemies over level 50 have 50
                                 subtracted from their level in the calculation.
                                 This section has been amended.

Ver 1.02 - August 26th 2011      Other parts of the guide have been better
                                 detailed and the status effect section has
                                 been corrected and updated.

1. ________________________________________________________________________
[ATB GAUGE]================================================================


_____________________ATB Level
 ___________________________________________________________________
| Condition                                               ATB Level |
|===================================================================|
| Starting Condition ............................................ 2 |
| Become a l'Cie ............................................... +1 |
| Gain a Summon ................................................ +1 |
| Obtained on the Crystallium Board ............................ +1 |
| Equip Bonus of Final Weapon .................................. +1 |
*===================================================================*

Because each character becomes a l'Cie and each of them will eventually gain a 
summon, 4 is the minimum final size of the ATB bar. Vanille and Fang join your 
party after they have already become l'Cie so they start off with a level 3 ATB
instead of level 2.



_____________________ATB Gauge Speed By Level

Each ATB slot has a size of 100 so an ATB Speed of 100 will fill one ATB slot 
in 1 second. An ATB bar at level 5 has a total size of 500, therefore, despite 
the apparently smaller size slots, each slot on a level 5 ATB bar is the same 
size as each slot on a level 2 ATB bar. The real difference comes from the 
fact that the ATB bar itself speeds up with each successive level.

 ________________________________________________________________________
| Level || ATB Speed || Time to Fill Each Slot || Time to Fill Whole Bar |
|=======||===========||========================||========================|
|   2   ||        62 ||               ~1.6 sec ||               ~3.2 sec |
|   3   ||        72 ||               ~1.4 sec ||               ~4.2 sec |
|   4   ||        92 ||               ~1.1 sec ||               ~4.3 sec |
|   5   ||       110 ||               ~0.9 sec ||               ~4.5 sec |
|   6   ||       128 ||               ~0.8 sec ||               ~4.7 sec |
*========================================================================*

This is the base rate if the ATB configuration settings are set to "Normal." 
If the configuration settings are set to "Slow" the Fill Speed becomes half 
and the resultant times double. Although not specifically stated, it can be 
assumed that this change applies to the enemies' ATB gauges as well.



_____________________Conditions which affect ATB speed

The following is a chart which shows the effect of different conditions on 
the ATB speed. The base ATB speed is determined only by the ATB level; these 
effects modify the base ATB speed.
 ____________________________________________________________________
| Ability                                                     Effect |
|====================================================================|
| Haste ....................................................... +50% |
| ATB Rate +X% ......................................... +10 to +30% |
| Slow ........................................................ -50% |
| Leadenstrike ................................................ -70% |
| Ironstrike .................................................. -40% |
*====================================================================*

The lower limit to the gauge speed is -90%. The status effects of Slow and 
Haste will cancel each other out such that casting Haste on a character 
affected by Slow will cancel both status effects and return that character to 
normal status. The ability ATB Rate +X% is a synthesized ability which 
increases from 10 to 30% depending on whether you have 2 or up to 5 pieces of 
equipment with the ability. The two abilities of the series: "Leadenstrike," 
and "Ironstrike" are weapon abilities which appear on some of the stronger 
weapons as a balance factor for using them.



_____________________Abilities which affect the ATB gauge

 _________________________________________________________________________
| Ability                                                          Effect |
|=========================================================================|
| Lifesiphon *(3) ............................................... +1 Slot |
| Faultsiphon *(3) ....................................... +20% of 1 Slot |
| Fearsiphon *(3) ........................................ +10% of 1 Slot |
| ATB Advantage ............................*(1) Start Battle with 1 Slot |
| Kill: ATB Charge *(3) ..............................*(1) +50% of 1 Slot |
| Attack: ATB Charge .................................*(2) +10% of 1 Slot |
| Attack: ATB Charge II ..............................*(2) +20% of 1 Slot |
*=========================================================================*

*(1)
Having more than 1 copy of these abilities will not increase the effect.
*(2)
If the damage is dealt by a Saboteur's ability and the status effect takes 
hold of the enemy, the ATB recovery is doubled.
*(3)
These abilities are of the siphon-type abilities and are affected by Hope's 
weapon ability: Siphon Boost. The first version of this ability gives 1.5 
times the effect while the upgraded version of this ability gives 2 
times the effect.

Lifesiphon and Faultsiphon are auto abilities in the Commando role, while 
Fearsiphon is an auto ability in the Ravager role. ATB Advantage and Kill: 
ATB Charge are abilities given by equipping certain accessories. The last 2 
abilities are from Lightning's Axis Blade and its upgraded forms.



_____________________Paradigm Shift and ATB

The ATB gauge will continue to increase during a paradigm shift. Assuming
the player shifts in the middle of an action, any unused amount of the ATB 
gauge will be saved in the same way it would have been saved if the player
had simply cancelled the action.

Paradigm shifting will refill everyone's ATB gauge. There is a 12 second 
cooldown time for this effect after each time it activates. This means if you
shift less than 12 seconds after this effect last activated, the ATB gauge 
will not be refilled at the end of the shift. The computer AI controlled 
characters will have their commands automatically selected immediately 
following the shift.

During the paradigm shift animation, commands cannot be input, nor will input
commands be carried out. During this animation the ATB gauges of both the 
party and the enemies will continue to increase. The 2 non-leader characters 
can act again sooner than the leader as the leader must wait until all 3
character's animations are finished before acting.

The first paradigm shift in each battle will have a longer animation. There
are ways to reduce the effects of this animation time however; you need 
only shift during an animation which cannot be canceled by the paradigm
shift. Those include:

     1.   During an [Attack] command special animation.
     2.   While being launched by an enemy.
     3.   While using a character's unique command skill (eg [Army of One]).

Circumventing the long animation will make the next shift animation a long
animation as well. Until you experience the longer shift animation without 
using one of the above methods to circumvent it, the shift animation will 
continue to try to use the longer animation.


2. ________________________________________________________________________
[Battle Rank]==============================================================


Battle Rank is calculated between 0 and 5 stars based on the score you receive 
at the end of the battle. The score itself is calculated in the following
manner:

Score = {[(Target Time) - (Battle Duration)] x (Points per second)} + 10,000

 __________________________________________________________________________
| Rank    | Score           | TP Recovery | Rare Drop % | Shroud Drop Rate |
|==========================================================================|
| 5 Stars | 13,000 and up   | 8x          | 5x          | Normal           |
| 4 Stars | 12,000 - 12,999 | 3x          | 3x          | Normal           |
| 3 Stars | 9,000 - 11,999  | Normal      | Normal      | Normal           |
| 2 Stars | 8,000 - 8,999   | Half        | None        | 2x               |
| 1 Star  | 7,000 - 7,999   | 1/4th       | None        | 4x               |
| 0 Stars | 0 - 6,999       | 1/8th       | None        | 8x               |
*==========================================================================*

   Target Time
   ===========
   Target Time is the amount of time necessary to achieve a score of 10,000. 
   Defeating the enemy faster will result in a higher score while taking 
   more time will result in a lower score.

   Target Time = [(Enemy Strength) / (Party Member Strength)] + 8

   Target Time has a max limit of 10 hours and a minimum of 12 seconds for 
   the first enemy and 4 seconds for each additional enemy. The Gold Watch 
   accessory, if equipped on a character who did not die in battle, will 
   multiply the Target Time by 1.1


       Enemy Strength
       ==============
       Enemy Strength is calculated as the following:

       [(HP at the start of Battle) x (enemy level)] / 16
   
       This value is calculated for each enemy and then all of the values 
       are taken as a sum to obtain "Enemy Strength". In the case that the 
       enemy's level is above 50, it is calculated as (Enemy Level - 50).

       Party Member Strength
       =====================
       Party Member Strength is calculated as the following:  

       [(Attack power x ATB Level) / (3.5 + ATB Level)]
   
       Where "attack power" is the highest value between either magic attack 
       or physical attack. This value is calculated for each party member and 
       then all of the values are taken as a sum to obtain "Party Member 
       Strength".


   Battle Duration
   ===============
   Battle duration is simply the amount of time spent in battle. Any extra time
   spent during a preemptive strike animation or a summon animation is not 
   included.


   Points per second
   =================
   Points per second = [(10,000) / (Target Time)]

   The US version renamed Battle Rate to "Points per second." 


Preempt Bonus
=============
In the case of a preemptive strike, the final score will be multiplied by 1.2



____________________Calculation

The time itself is calculated in seconds and always rounded down. In 
other words, there is no difference between 56 seconds and 56.9 seconds.

Let's assume you have Fang, Hope, and Lightning in your party with the
following stats:

Lightning - PA: 1500
            MA: 1400
            ATB: 5

Fang      - PA: 2500
            MA: 1000
            ATB: 6

Hope      - PA: 1200
            MA: 2500
            ATB: 6

Party Member Strength = [(Attack power x ATB Level) / (3.5 + ATB Level)]

Lightning - [(1500 x 5) / (3.5 + 5)] = 882
Fang      - [(2500 x 6) / (3.5 + 6)] = 1578
Hope      - [(2500 x 6) / (3.5 + 6)] = 1578

Party Member Strength = 882 + 1578 + 1578 = 4038


Now take this party against a party of 3 enemies with the following stats:

Enemy 1   - HP: 500,000
            Level: 15

Enemy 2   - HP: 10,000
            Level: 10

Enemy 3   - HP: 20,000
            Level: 10

Enemy Strength = [(HP at the start of Battle) x (enemy level)] / 16

Enemy 1 - [(500000) x (15)] / 16 = 468750
Enemy 2 - [(10000) x (10)] / 16 = 6250
Enemy 3 - [(20000) x (20)] / 16 = 25000

Enemy Strength = 468750 + 6250 + 25000 = 500,000


Target Time will therefore become:

Target Time = [(Enemy Strength) / (Party Member Strength)] + 8
Target Time = [(500000) / (4038)] + 8 = 131 seconds


Pointers for increasing your Battle Rank
========================================

1) You can equip the Gold Watch accessory to increase the Target Time,
   but equipping more than 1 will not help. 

2) Not equipping the ultimate weapons will not only decrease your attack 
   power, it will also decrease your ATB gauge giving you even more allotted 
   time. 

3) Items with Auto-brave / faith can increase damage without increasing 
   attack power, while items with auto-haste will decrease the amount of time 
   taken to defeat the enemy party. 

4) In any given party, you will probably have 1 physical attacker, 1
   magical attacker, and 1 support character. Your support character does 
   not need high attack power; this should increase the allotted time.

|<---------------------------- 2100 ------------------------------------->|

The TP bar is a total of 2100 points long with the first 2 bars being 100 and 
200 points respectively and the last 3 bars being 600 points each. 

TP abilities use the TP of only the full bars beginning at level 5 and 
working its way down to the level 1 bar. In other words, TP abilities cost 
more TP if your bar is full. For instance, a summon ability used at TP level 
5 will cost 1800 TP or rather, bars 3 through 5. The same ability used at TP 
level 3 will cost 1000 TP, or bars 1 through 3. 

If you happen to have Bar 5 half full when you use a summon, the summon 
ability will completely use bars 2 through 4 and the remaining half will fill 
bar 2. In this case, even though Bar 5 had 300 TP, when it is converted to 
fill Bar 2, it will only fill it by the same percentage. This means that you 
will essentially lose 200 TP since Bar 2 will only fill by 100.



____________________TP Recovery


The amount of TP recovered after each battle is based on the enemy level and 
the Battle rank at the end of battle.

Rank                      Recovery
0 stars               Sum of enemies' levels / 8
1 star                Sum of enemies' levels / 4
2 stars               Sum of enemies' levels / 2
3 stars               Sum of enemies' levels
4 stars               Sum of enemies' levels * 3
5 stars               Sum of enemies' levels * 8                    

Enemy levels are not intuitive in this game as even early bosses have levels 
above 50 while one of the strongest enemies in the game is only level 7. 
Levels are more of a battle calculation factor than an indicator of ability 
so keep in mind that you may very well gain more TP from a group of weak 
enemies than from a strong enemy.

*1
During a summon, recovery amount = 0
*2
During a summon, recovery amount = 10

If a party member has the Synthesized Ability: Gestalt/TP Boost and is not 
dead, all listed values become double; this doubling affect the actions of 
all party members, not just the person with the ability. If the recovery 
due to the increase from Gestalt/TP Boost becomes more than 10, then 
recovery equals [(2 * normal) - 1].

_____________________Role Bonuses


Commando
****************************************************************************
* The Commando's role bonus adds a percentage to the damage dealt to the   * 
* enemies. This bonus applies to both physical and magical damage. If      *
* there is more than one Commando in the party, the bonus is the sum of    *
* all applicable Commando bonuses.                                         *
****************************************************************************

Ravager
****************************************************************************
* The Ravager's role bonus adds a fixed value to the base amount each and  *
* every skill increases the Chain Gauge. This bonus applies to all skills  *
* which can increase the Chain Gauge and is cumulative with the bonus from * 
* other Ravagers.                                                          *
****************************************************************************

Sentinel
****************************************************************************
* The Sentinel's role bonus reduces the damage dealt by both physical and  *
* magical attacks. This bonus applies even if the attack ignores type      *
* based Defense. If there is more than one Sentinel in the party, the      *
* bonus is the product of all applicable Sentinel bonuses. If Lightning is *
* a level 5 Sentinel (self bonus of 0.50) and has two role level 3         *
* Sentinels on her team (party bonus of 0.89 each)then her total bonus     *
* would be equal to 0.50 x 0.89 x 0.89 = 0.396 = 0.40                      *
****************************************************************************

Saboteur
****************************************************************************
* The Saboteur's role bonus increases the success rate for all status      *
* afflictions which target the enemies. This bonus applies to the base     *
* rate by multiplying the bonus factor by the base rate. If there is more  * 
* than one Saboteur in the party, the bonus factor is the sum of all       *
* applicable Saboteur role bonuses. For example, a base success rate of    *
* 30% in the hands of a Level 5 Saboteur will become 30% + (30% x 0.4) =   *
* 42%; it does NOT become 30% + 40% = 70%.                                 * 
****************************************************************************

Synergist
****************************************************************************
* The Synergist's role bonus increases the duration of offensive and       *
* defensive buffing status effects. This bonus applies in the exact same   * 
* mechanism as the Saboteur's bonus.                                       *
****************************************************************************

Medic
****************************************************************************
* The Medic's role bonus increases HP recovery by a percentage. This bonus *
* is directly applied to the recovery amount. If there is more than one    *
* Medic in the party, the bonus is equal to the sum of all applicable      *
* Medic role bonuses. For instance, if recovery was going to be 350 HP, a  * 
* Level 5 Medic bonus would make it 350 + (350 x 0.32) = 462.              *

*===========================================================================*

The Self Bonus only applies to the individual in that particular job while 
the Party Bonus only applies to their teamates. In a party consisting of one 
Role Level 5 Commando and one Role Level 3 Commando, the Level 5 Commando 
will have a bonus of: (150% + 10%) while the Level 3 Commando will have a 
bonus of: (120% + 15%). 

Any incapacitated party members do not contribute their bonus. Likewise, when 
summoning, only the lead character's bonus applies until the summon is 
dismissed and the other 2 party members return.



____________________AI by Role


Each of the roles has a hidden gambit-like AI system such that the computer 
will predictably use specific skills in specific situations. If the player 
uses the auto-input method for the leader; it will input in accordance to the 
role AI.


Commando
========
Commandos will use their attacks based on their own stats and the physical
and magical defense of the enemy. For example, Hope will usually have more 
magic power than attack power so he will typically choose to use the skill 
[Ruin] over the skill [Attack]. 

If there is more than one Commando, the AI will aim for an enemy that is not 
being targeted by the other Commando.


Ravager
=======
Aims for the same opponent as the Commando. If there is no Commando in the 
party, it will aim for the same enemy as the leader. If the leader is not 
targeting an enemy, it will aim for the same target as another ravager or 
simply auto-target if there is no other Ravager.

When attacking, the AI chooses attacks more suited to raising the chain 
bonus rather than choosing attacks based on damage. 

The AI will use attacks that the enemy is weak to and, in turn, will 
never use an attack that the enemy will absorb. The AI can only know this if 
the information is displayed in the Libra menu.


Sentinel
========
Always uses [Provoke] first unless all opponents are immune. Attempts to 
force all opponenets to target itself. After the opponenets are successfully 
provoked, it proceeds to use Counter, Evade, and Guard type abilities.

When not critical the AI will use [Vendetta] and [Entrench]. When critical, 
the AI will more often use [Steelguard], [Mediguard], and [Elude].


Saboteur
========
Uses debuffing and debilitation spells on the enemies.
If the Libra screen lists any recommended status effects under the "Notes" 
heading, the Saboteur AI will carry out these effects first if possible.

Otherwise, if the enemies are great in number, the AI will use debilitation 
type spells, but if the enemies are few in number, the AI will use debuffing 
spells.

The AI will not use any status effects which the Libra screen reveals to be 
ineffective against that enemy.


Synergist
=========
Pattern Flow

1. Buffs in accordance with the Libra "Notes" screen as indicated by the    
   chart below.
2. Uses En-{Element) if the Libra screen says the targeted enemy is weak 
   to that element.
3. Uses Haste on itself.
4. Uses other buffs; defense when the enemies are great in number and augment
   when the enemies are few in number.


Synergist AI response Chart:
 ____________________________________________________________
| "Notes" Description                               Response |

| Carries out strong magic attacks...........Shell / Shellra |
| Carries out (insert) elemental attacks.......Half (insert) |
| Uses (insert) status effect attack....................Veil |
*============================================================*


Medic
=====

1. Heal anyone with HP less than 30% starting with the leader.
2. Heal anyone with HP less than 70% starting with the leader.
3. Recover the dead.
4. Recover negative status effects.
5. Fill each character's life to full using only 1 cure stock at a time.

The medic will heal until all living allies are at 70% or more health before 
trying to revive or remove status effects. After everyone is alive and above 
70% health, it will continue to restore the life of allies by using only 1
cure stock at a time.

If you wish to restore a negative status effect or revive someone before
everyone is at 70% health, you will need to manually control the Medic.



5. ________________________________________________________________________
[Chain & Stagger]==========================================================



____________________Chain Bonus Calculation

Chain Bonus increase is equal to the following:


[(Skill base + Base mod) * Chain resist mod + Conditional mod] * Resist mod


Skill base        - Chain value of the skill used. See section 9 for a list.

Base mod          - Abilities and bonuses which directly modifiy the skill's
                    base chain value.

Chain resist mod  - Equal to [(100 - Enemy Chain Res)/100]
                    This is the enemy's resistance to having their chain 
                    gauge increased. If the enemy's chain res is 90 then the
                    chain resist mod would be 0.10.

Conditional mod   - This is a bonus amount of chain that can be added in
                    certain circumstances. See list [A] for details. Even if
                    the enemy has 100 chain res the conditional mod will
                    still allow the player to raise the chain gauge.

Resist mod        - See the resist mod tables listed below for details.
                    This is the modifier in relation to any applicable 
                    elemental resistance that the target has. Only Table B:
                    Chain Resistance will apply to the chain bonus 
                    calculation, the other table is used in the damage
                    calculation in section 8.


Base modifiers
==============

Auto Abilities   -  {Jeopardize} (COM)      - +1.0 against a staggered 
                                              target
                 -  {Overwhelm} (RAV)       - +1.0 for each other ally 
                                              targeting the same enemy
                 -  {Vigor} (RAV)           - +1.0 is HP is above 70%
Weapon Abilities -  Chain Bonus Boost       - +1.0 (Sazh)
                 -  Chain Bonus Boost II    - +2.0 (Sazh)
Other            -  Ravager Role Bonus      - +0.1 - 3.6 [see section 4]


Conditional Modifiers
=====================

     The following table is a list of the conditional modifiers for the
     chain bonus calculation. These modifiers vary by role and often have
     2 conditions; both of which must be met in order for the bonus to the 
     chain gauge to be applied. All of the modifiers in this table can
     be stacked with each other provided the character meets all requirements
     including the role requirement.

     SUM is the list of conditional modifiers for the Eidolons.

Resist Mod Tables
=================

Table A: Damage modifiers
 _________________________________________________________
|_______________|_________ Elemental Resistance __________|
|Type Resistance|  Abs | Null |Resist| Half | Norm | Weak |
|===============|======|======|======|======|======|======|
| Null          |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |    0 |
| Resist        |  Abs |    0 | 0.01 | 0.05 |  0.1 |  0.2 |
| Half          |  Abs |    0 | 0.05 | 0.25 |  0.5 |    1 |

| Weak          |  --- |    0 |  0.2 |    1 |    2 |    4 |
*=========================================================*

     Abs  - Enemy absorbs 100% of the damage dealt. The damage dealt will
            vary with resistances.
     ---  - There are no enemies that both absorb elemental damage and are 
            weak to type based damage.


Table B: Chain Bonus modifiers
 _________________________________________________________
|_______________|_________ Elemental Resistance __________|
|Type Resistance|  Abs | Null |Resist| Half | Norm | Weak |
|===============|======|======|======|======|======|======|
| Null          | 0.25 | 0.25 |  0.5 |  0.5 |    1 |   1* |
| Resist        | 0.25 | 0.25 |  0.5 |  0.5 |    1 |   1* |
| Half          | 0.25 | 0.25 |  0.5 |  0.5 |    1 |   1* |
| Norm          | 0.25 | 0.25 |  0.5 |  0.5 |    1 |   1* |
| Weak          |  --- | 0.25 |  0.5 |  0.5 |    1*|   1* |
*=========================================================*

     1*   - The actual modifier is still 1 but the increase to the chain 
            gauge will be more due to the conditional modifiers for weakness.
     ---  - There are no enemies that both absorb elemental damage and are 
            weak to type based damage.


Chain Bonus
===========
The chain bonus gauge raises before damage is dealt. An attack which raises
the chain gauge by 10 against an enemy with a chain bonus already at 190 
will deal damage as though the chain bonus were 200 (190 + 10).

It is impossible to raise the chain bonus gauge above the stagger limit 
percentage unless the enemy has been staggered.



____________________Stagger

Effect on All Enemies
=====================
When staggered, the chain bonus percentage increases by 100.
Any chain resistance becomes zero
All actions with a keep of 89 or less have their keep reduced to zero.


Effect on Some Enemies
======================
Type and/or elemental resistances lower
Status resistance lowers
They become easier to launch
Attack pattern changes


Near Stagger
============
At about 90-92% of a full stagger gauge, the enemy will turn red and the chain
bonus will flash. This indicates the enemy has reached the "near stagger"
status. 

This is most applicable to Lightning's weapon ability: Quick Stagger. With 
this ability, Lightning will instantly stagger enemies who are in near stagger 
status. This means an enemy with a stagger gauge of 700 can be staggered as
early as 630 with Lightning's ability.


Stagger Time Limit
==================
Minimum of 8 seconds, maximum of 45 seconds. The stagger time limit is equal 
to double the remaining gauge time when the enemy was staggered.


Effect of Gestalt Mode on Stagger
=================================
The chain gauge will reset after Gestalt mode ends regardless of whether or 
not the Eidolon's finisher was used.


Effect of Preempt on Stagger
============================
Preempting the enemy raises all enemy chain gauges to 95-96% full. The 
chain gauge duration for this effect is 10 seconds.



____________________Abilities which affect stagger

Stagger Lock
============
A character with this ability can not stagger an enemy. They can still raise
the chain bonus up to the stagger limit but they can neither stagger the 
enemy nor raise the chain bonus above the stagger limit. Other party members
(assuming they do not also have stagger lock) can stagger the enemy. Against 
a staggered enemy, the character with this ability can continue to raise the 
chain bonus gauge as normal.


Quick Stagger
=============
The attack of the character with this skill will stagger an opponent in "near
stagger" status. This makes it possible to stagger opponents who only have
90-92% of their full stagger limit.


Stagger Maintenance
===================
Stagger time limit increases by 10% if Sazh was the one who broke the target. 
This ability will not increase the stagger duration past the maximum limit of
45 seconds. The upgraded version of this ability increases the stagger time
limit by 30%.


Random: Instant Chain
=====================
This gives the character a 0.5% chance of instantly raising the chain bonus
up to the stagger limit with each hit. The actual ability will not stagger
the target but the next attack will send the opponent into stagger status.

The only requirement for Random: Instant Chain to activate is for the Chain
Bonus gauge to increase by some value greater than zero as a result of the
attack. Each time the bonus gauge raises by any amount greater than zero there
will be a 0.5% chance of the gauge instantly raising to the stagger limit.

This ability will not work on enemies over level 49. This means it will not
work on any bosses (as all bosses are above level 49) and will not work
against some of the more elite marks such as the mark from Mission 51 and
the mark from Mission 64.


The random chance of instantly raising the gauge is based solely on the number 
of times the chain bonus value is calculated. Since Sazh's [Attack] command 
does not have more than one chain bonus calculation this gives him only one 
chance per use of [Attack] regardless of the fact that he hits the enemy 
2 times with each [Attack] command. 

On the other hand, Sazh's unique skill [Cold Blood] calculates the chain 
bonus 17 times. This gives 17 chances for Random: Instant Chain to activate. 
Even though [Cold Blood] has a base chain bonus rate of zero on all 17 hits
if the enemy is not staggered, it can still activate the skill Random: Instant 
Chain as long as the enemy chain gauge is increasing by some amount.



____________________Ally Chain Bonus

Your allies each have a chain bonus gauge as well but these gauges do not 
actually increase the damage they receive. Ally chain bonus gauges are used 
in the Medic healing and Synergist status effect calculations.



6. ________________________________________________________________________
[Status Effects]===========================================================



____________________Effect Chance Calculation

The chance for a status effect to inflict upon the target is as follows:

 (Base skill %) * (alteration due to target's resistance) * Chain Bonus

The base skill percentage can be found in the table of skills. The alteration 
due to resistance is basically equal to [(100 - Enemy Res) / 100]; such that 
if the enemy has 10 resistance against the effect you are trying to inflict 
the "alteration due to target's resistance" will equal 0.90. The chain bonus 
is taken as a percent value so 100% will give a multiplier of 1 while 255% 
will give a multiplier of 2.55.

In the case of the skill Death, the chain bonus factor of the equation is 
ignored.

 and a maximum bonus of 1.64 times chance

The effects in the table above will alter the calculated % chance. After
calculating the chance via the above equation, that value is then altered
in accordance with any effects listed above.


Status Resistance
=================
Status resistances, both enemy and player, are not entirely static. They
can be altered during battle through various un-intuitive means. All
effects in the following chart can affect players as well as enemies.

    ______________________________________________________________
   |          Condition          |             Change             |
   |==============================================================|
   | Using an ability which tries| Each failed attempt will lower |
   | but fails to add a status   | the target's status resistance |
   | effect to the target.       | to that effect by 2 points.    |
   |==============================================================|
   | While being affected by a   | Every 2 seconds, resistance to |
   | status effect.              | that effect goes up by 1 point.|
   |==============================================================|
   | Just after a status effect  | Every 2 seconds, resistance to |
   | has worn off of the target  | that effect goes down by 1     |
   | effect to the target.       | point.                         |
   *==============================================================*

First Condition
---------------
Each time you unsuccessfully cast Slow on a target, for instance, that
target's resistance to Slow will go down by 2 points. If that target had
70 resistance to Slow, after 5 unsuccessful castings, it will only have
60 resistance to Slow. This only affects the resistance of the status
effect being cast and cannot lower resistance below 0.

This condition also requires that the target is not already affected
by the status effect. Once you have slowed the target, using Slow on
it unsuccessfully will no longer lower the target's resistance to
slow.

This will also have no affect on immunities. No matter how many times
you use a status effect, if the target is immune to it, they will remain
immune.


Second Condition
----------------
If, for instance, that target was successfully slowed after its
resistance to slow had dropped to 50, it would gain 1 point of 
resistance every 2 seconds. After 10 seconds had passed, it would have
55 resistance to slow.

This will never cause resistance to go above 99.


Third Condition
---------------
Using that same example, just after slow has worn off of that target,
its resistance will go down by 1 point every 2 seconds. This is meant
to offset the increase in resistance experienced while affected by
slow.

This will never cause resistance to go below its starting value. In
the case of the enemy in the example, this condition will never cause 
its resistance to slow to drop below 70.



____________________Effect Duration Calculation


The length of a status effect can be calculated by the following formula:

         Base Length * Chain Bonus + (MA of the caster / 100)

This formula is used for both positive and negative status effects. In either 
case, the chain bonus of the target is used in the calculation (this affects 
allies as well).




____________________List of Effects


Note: Dispelga and Death will remove all status effects except death
      sentence and provoke.

*1 Will not raise Keep above 89. Will not boost the keep of a move that
   is alread above 89.
*2 Any attack which originally held this elemental property will deal 
   1.3 times normal damage as long as this status effect remains.
   As well, when using {Smite}, some of the Eidolon attacks, or any of
   the Limit Breaks except for Death, the elemental property will not 
   change.
   Most of the Eidolon abilities will still not gain the x1.3 bonus even
   if the original elemental property matches the status effect.
   When hitting an enemy that resists, halves, absorbs, or nullifies this
   element, the En-ability is canceled automatically.

   by Imperil, they simply take double damage.
*5 Will not reduce the values below 0. Any Keep values that are above 89
   will not be affected by the reduction.
*6 Although it's not explained, the counter for Death Sentence will not
   decrease during an Eidolon Summon.

[Eidolons]=================================================================


____________________Rank

The rank of an Eidolon determines its stats.

Eidolon Rank is equal to:

                    Crystarium level + (# of level 5 roles)

Only the level 5 roles of the owner of the summon count towards the rank of 
that summon. The max rank of any Eidolon is 16 (Crystarium level 10 + 6 roles 
at level 5).



____________________SP


All Eidolons are given a base of 50 seconds to battle from the point of 
summoning them until the SP gauge runs out. 100% of the SP gauge is equal to 
50 seconds of time no matter how big or small the max SP gauge happens to be.

SP itself is only there as a damage buffer. If a summon with 10,000 SP takes 
1000 damage, it has lost 1/10th of its max SP or rather 5 seconds of time. If 
that same summon has 50,000 SP instead, it has only lost 1/50th of its max SP 
or just 1 second.



___________________Gestalt Gauge


The Gestalt gauge starts half full upon summoning. Th method to raise the 
Gestalt gauge is the exact same as the method to raise it during Summon 
Battles [see Summon Battles section] except the summon multipliers are 
ignored.

When the SP gauge completely depletes, the Gestalt gauge will begin to deplete 
at a rate of 20% each second.

                                     50%    60%    70%    80%    90%    100%

The amount of Gestalt gauge remaining when Gestalt mode is activated determines 
both the Gestalt count and the level of the Gestalt mode finishing move as 
illustrated above.



____________________Summon Battles

During Summon Battles the goal is to raise the Gestalt Gauge, which appears 
above the summon monster's head, to full and then press Square. The summon 
will use Death sentence against your leader from the start giving a counter 
of 1800 which equals 3 minutes of time. Note that if you have set the ATB 
gauge to slow from the config menu, the counter will be 1.8 times longer for 
a count of 3214 which equals 5 minutes and 21 seconds.

The Gestalt gauge during a summon battle goes from 0% - 100% and raises by a 
various percentage based on the actions taken by both the leader and the 
other party members. Note that you can raise the gauge without even attacking 
the summon.

________________Summoning


All attacks made during Gestalt mode ignore type-based defense; this means 
physical and magical defense. None of the eidolons have attacks in normal 
mode which ignore type-based defense.

All Gestalt mode finishing moves have 3 levels but the move itself does not 
deal more damage based on the level. Each Gestalt mode finishing move raises
the chain gauge prior to dealing damage. The level of the finishing move
determines how much the chain gauge rises prior to dealing damage. Since 
this gauge percentage increase will also increase the amount of damage dealt
the level of the Gestalt mode finishing moves indirectly increases damage.

All elementally aligned attacks in both normal and Gestalt mode will ignore 
any positive elemental resistance. These attacks will not ignore negative 
resistances so an enemy weak to that element will take more damage, while 
an enemy strong to that element will still take normal damage.

All summons except for Hecatoncheir have the skill Curaga. This cure spell
does not rely on any formulae; it always fully recovers HP. In addition, 
although summons might have skills with the same name (such as [Thundaga])
the values for the skill are not always the same as the player versions.

Note that if you have a US system, the first 3 Gestalt moves will require an X 
while the fourth move will require a O. If you have a Japanese system, the 
first 3 moves in Gestalt mode will require a O while the fourth move will 
require an X. I have written the charts with a US system in mind.


ATB              - This lists the size of the ATB gauge of that summon.
Starting amount  - This is the amount of the ATB gauge that summon begins
                   with. Odin has a starting amount of 5 so when he is 
                   summoned, he has 5 full bars of ATB.

Abilities        - Each summon has their own set of action abilities.
Auto-Abilities   - Each summon has their own set of auto-abilities. The auto 
                   abilities are not all active at all times. In the case 
                   that the summon needs to activate the ability, the 
                   activation requirements will be listed. Even once 
                   activated, the auto ability's effect will wear off 
                   following the end of the next turn.
Gestalt Mode     - Cost   - The amount of the Gestalt meter which is consumed
                            by this skill. In the case more than one number
                            is listed, the subsequent numbers are the amount 
                            the skill will consume on consecutive uses.

Normal Actions
--------------
1. Attacks the enemy which Lightning is targeting with [Flourish of Steel], 
   [Skyward Swing], and [Seismic Strike]. It will stock 4 attacks from the 
   previous 3 skills on its ATB bar and then have [Thundaga] as the 5th 
   attack.

2. It often begins its attacks with [Flourish of Steel].

3. While Odin's ATB gauge is filling up it will activate Ullr's Shield.

Arise             - Target fully recovers from death and negative status 
                    effects.
Ullr's Shield     - While in effect, all damage Odin receives is reduced by 
                    10%.
                    Activation: If Odin has come within range of his
                    target and his ATB gauge is still filling up, he will

Left or Right + X - Razor Gale
------------------------------
The upper portion values are for the sword itself while the lower values are 
for the collision damage.

O - Thunderfall
---------------
The Rise value for this move is 4 for the first 2 hits and 2 for the 3rd hit.
Against a broken opponent, the Rise value for this move is 7 for the first 2
hits.

Finish - Zantetsuken
--------------------
The Rise value for this move is normally 0 but against a broken opponent, it
becomes 1.5. This move will raise the Chain Bonus gauge by a various amount 
based on level prior to dealing damage as follows:

Level 1: 17.00 * 3 =  51.00
Level 2: 17.00 * 5 =  85.00
Level 3: 17.00 * 8 = 136.00

Zantetsuken has a hidden instant kill property. Zantetsuken will instant kill 
the enemy regardless of whether or not the enemy is immune to the Death status 
effect. The instant kill will take effect if the target's HP is less than the 
following prior to dealing damage:

[3 * Odin's PA * (Chain Bonus)^2]

That is three multiplied by Odin's physical attack stat multiplied by the 
chain bonus percentage squared. If the chain bonus is 300% and Odin's PA is 
4504 then it would be:

[3 * 4504 * (3)^2] = [13512 * 9] = 121,608

The enemy would need to have less than 121,608 HP prior to the activation
of Zantetsuken for the finishing move to instant kill the enemy.

Shiva is a 2-part summon. Stiria is the one who's stats will be revealed on 
the status screen but Nix has her own set of stats. The only stat they share 
is the SP gauge. If either one of them are attacked in battle, the SP gauge 
is reduced.

While in Driving mode, only Stiria's stats are used in the damage 
calculations.

Stiria - ATB: 3                    Starting amount: 0
Nix    - ATB: 4                    Starting amount: 3.5

All of Alexander's moves needed to be shortened to fit in the chart.
In order they are:
[Steelcrusher], [Obliterator], [Soaring Uppercut], [Blast Punch],
[Explosive Fist], and [Lofty Challenge]

Obliterator
-----------
The upper values listed are for the initial swing and the lower values are
for the backhand attack.

Soaring Uppercut
----------------
The Rise value for this move is normally 3.5 but against a staggered 
target, the Rise value for this move becomes 6.

Explosive Fist
--------------
The upper values listed are for the left arm attack while the lower values
are for the resulting explosion. The Rise value for this move is normally
3 but against a staggered target, the Rise value for this move becomes 6.


Auto-Abilities
--------------
Arise             - Target fully recovers from death and negative status 
                    effects.


Gestalt Mode
============
Unlike the other Eidolons, Alexander is the only one who has Gestalt moves 
that do not ignore type based defense. This means both positive and negative
defense will not be ignored by the 2 moves which do not ignore defense.

*==========================================================================*


Up + X - Purification
---------------------
This moves does not ignore defense. Each of the hits in this move has a chance 
of applying the status effect deshell (Effect: 100%  Length: 4s).


Down + X - Earthquake
---------------------
The upper values are for enemies close to Alexander while the lower values
are for enemies far from Alexander when using this move.


Left or Right + X - Brutal Sanction
-----------------------------------
This move does not ignore defense. This move has a chance of applying the 
status effect deprotect (Effect: 100%  Length: 4.33s).


O - Retributive Blast
---------------------
The upper values are for the initial attack while the lower values are for
the explosion afterwards.


Finish - Divine Judgement
-------------------------
This move will raise the Chain Bonus gauge by a various amount based on level 
prior to dealing damage as follows:

Level 1: 8.00 * 1 + 18.00 * 2 + 19.00 * 3 =  101.00
Level 2: 8.00 * 1 + 18.00 * 3 + 19.00 * 4 =  138.00
Level 3: 8.00 * 2 + 18.00 * 5 + 19.00 * 6 =  220.00


Divine Judgement will deal more damage based on the weaknesses of the target:

1.         If the target is weak to either physical or magical attacks
           -----Final damage becomes Normal damage * 2.00

2.         If the target is weak to at least one element
           -----Final damage becomes Normal damage * 2.00

3.         If the target has either deprotect or deshell
           -----Final damage becomes Normal damage * 1.89

These effects are cumulative and are taken as a product such that if the target
is weak to at least one element, weak to either physical or magical attacks, 
and has either deprotect or deshell the final damage will actually equal:

Normal damage * (2.00 * 2.00 * 1.89) = Normal damage * 7.56

Where "Normal damage" simply refers to the amount of damage that would have
been dealt without the modification. Suppose Alexander uses Divine
Judgement under the following conditions:

Alexander's PA is 7371
The target has a chain bonus of 999%
The target has deshell
The target is weak to fire
The target is weak to physical attacks

Divine Judgement has a base multiplier of 3.0 so the base damage will be
7371 * 3.0 = 22,113. This is further increased by the chain bonus percentage
to give 22,113 * 9.99 = 220,908. Since none of the other calculations apply
to Divine Judgement (see section 9 for details on attack damage) this will
be the Normal damage value. The conditional multiplier will be 7.56 so the
actual damage dealt will equal 220,908 * 7.56 = 1,670,0064.

the amount damage dealt.


Table B:
 _____________________________________________
| Type | Status Effect                 Effect |
|=============================================|
| Phys | Bravery ...................... x 1.4 |
| Phys | Bravera ...................... x 1.8 |
| Phys | Debrave ...................... x 0.1 |
| Mag  | Faith ........................ x 1.4 |
| Mag  | Faithra ...................... x 1.8 |
| Mag  | Defaith ...................... x 0.1 |
*=============================================*

Most of the effects from this table counter-act each other. You can only have 
1 of either faith, Faithra, or defaith. Likewise, you can only have 1 of 
either Bravery, Bravera, or debrave at any given time. Given the fact that no 
abilities use both magical and physical attack in the calculation, the 
effects in this table will never compound.


Table C:
 ________________________________________________________
| Type | Ability                                  Effect |
|========================================================|
| Both | Commando Role Bonus ................ +5% - 180% |
| Both | X Elemental Damage% Up ............  +20% - 50% |
| Phys | Enfeeblement ............................. -50% |
| Phys | Hindrance ................................ -30% |
| Mag  | Stiffed Magic ............................ -50% |
| Mag  | Fettered Magic ........................... -30% |
| Phys | Vendetta .......................... +10% - 300% |
| Phys | Entrench .......................... +30% - 150% |
*========================================================*

The Elemental Damage% Up abilities are synthesis abilities which effect one 
element. This bonus only applies in the case that the attack in question is 
of that element. The damage dealt by Vendetta and Charge is the damage it 
deals at the end of a turn in which the Sentinel used those abilities. 

Including the Commando Role Bonus, the upper limit for [Vendetta] and
[Entrench] is +300%. 


Table D:
 _____________________________________________
| Type | Status Effect                 Effect |
|=============================================|
| Phys | Deprotect ..................... -89% |
| Mag  | Deshell ....................... -89% |
| Phys | Protect ..................... x 0.67 |
| Phys | Protectra ................... x 0.50 |
| Mag  | Shell ....................... x 0.67 |
| Mag  | Shellra ..................... x 0.50 |
| Both | Bar-(Element) ............... x 0.50 |
| Both | Deathward ................... x 0.75 |
| Both | Critical: Shield ............ x 0.85 |
| Both | Critical: Shield II ......... x 0.70 |
*=============================================*

Deprotect and deshell are subtracted directly from physical and magical 
resistance while the other affects are taken as a product and multiplied 
against the damage. It is impossible to have both the protect(da) and 
deprotect status effects at the same time; likewise it is also impossible to 
have both shell(da) and deshell status effects at the same time.

If Lightning has 38% physical resistance granted to her by accessories, the 
deprotect status effect would bring her physical resistance down to -51% 
causing her to take 51% more damage from physical attacks. This would 
increase her physical resistance multiplier from 0.62 (with the 38% 
resistance she started out with) up to 1.51. If she also happened to have the 
{Deathward} auto ability activated then 1.51 would be multiplied by 0.75 
to give a damage multiplier of 1.13.

The Bar-(Element) abilities only work on physical or magical attacks which 
are aligned towards that particular element. This acts as 50% resistance 
against that element as elemental and physical resistances are taken and will 
be taken as a product with any accessory based resistance of that same 
element. The total will be taken as a product with any applicable multipliers 
from the above table.

For instance, if Vanille has 30% Fire resistance from accessories and has the 
status effect Half Fire cast on her, her Fire resistance multiplier becomes 
0.5 * 0.7 = 0.35 or 65% fire resistance. If she is hit with a fire elemental 
magic attack and has the status effect shell at the time, the damage deal to 
her is multiplied by a factor of: 0.35 * 0.5 = 0.15.


Table E:
 _____________________________________________
| Type | Status Effect                 Effect |
|=============================================|
| Both | Sentinel Role Bonus ...... -8% - 63% |
| Both | Steelguard ............. -20% - 100% |
| Both | Mediguard ..................... -20% |
| Both | Vendetta ...................... -10% |
| Both | Entrench ...................... -10% |
| Both | Elude ......................... -20% |
*=============================================*

Even if the attack ignores "type" defense, it does not ignore the defense 
from this table. All applicable effects from this table are taken as a sum 
before being applied to the damage factor. Once all applicable effects have 
been added together, the resulting percentage is converted to a multiplier.

The Sentinel Role Bonus is the product of all applicable Sentinel Role 
Bonuses. A Sentinel Role Bonus of 0.40 becomes a -60% damage effect. If 
Lightning has this bonus and decides to use [Elude], her total 
bonus becomes -60% + -20% = -80%. This is then converted to a damage 
multiplier of 0.20



_____________________Damage Resolution


Base Damage is calculated as:


                base damage = parameter x damage multiplier


Where the parameter is the respective attack parameter (attack for physical-
type abilities, magic for magic-type abilities) and the damage multiplier is 
the base multiplier of the ability.

A normal Fight command from Lightning will have the base damage multiplier of 
1.2, if she also has 1700 attack power, her base damage will be 1700 x 1.2 = 
2040. 

After obtaining the Base Damage, the damage will be further modified by the 
following cycle:

1. Parameter Changing Abilities:
***********************************************************
* Take the sum of any applicable effects from Table A and *
* increase the base damage by this amount to obtain D1.   * 
***********************************************************

2. Parameter Changing Status Effects:
***********************************************************
* Take the sum of any applicable effects from Table B and *
* increase D1 by this amount to obtain D2                 *
***********************************************************

3. Random Damage Factor:
***********************************************************
* Take 100% minus the Variance modifier of the skill and  *
* multiply the resultant percentage by D2 to obtain the   *
* lower limit of the damage D2L.                          *
***********************************************************

4. Chain:
***********************************************************
* Take D2 and multiply it by the Chain % to obtain        *
* D3.                                                     *
***********************************************************

5. Bonuses granted by Table C:
***********************************************************
* Take the sum of any applicable effects from Table C and *
* increase D3 by this amount to obtain D4.                *
***********************************************************

6. Enhance Element abilities:
***********************************************************
* If the user has the Enhance Element status effect which * 
* corresponds to the affinity of the skill used then D5   *
* is D4 x 1.3; else D5 is D4 x 1.0.                       *
***********************************************************

7. Deathblow:
***********************************************************
* If the condition for the Deathblow auto ability exists  *
* then D6 is D5 x 1.5; else D6 is D5 x 1.0.               *
***********************************************************

8. Resistances:
***********************************************************
* Modify D6 in accordance to enemy resistances as         *
* explained in Chart 1 below to obtain D7. This step only *
* occurs for enemies and does not apply to the player.    *
***********************************************************

9. Damage changed by Table D:
***********************************************************
* Take the product of the applicable effects from Table D *
* and multiply D7 by this result to obtain D8.            *
***********************************************************

10. Bonus defense from Table E:
***********************************************************
* Take D8 and subsequently change its value by any        *
* applicable effects from Table E to obtain D9. The       *
* effects from Table E are taken as a sum.                *
***********************************************************

11. Auto-Ability Effect: Fringeward
***********************************************************
* If the auto ability Fringeward applies, take D9 and     *
* multiply it by 0.65 to obtain D10, otherwise D10 equals *
* D9. If the Barrier Up ability is equipped and this      *
* effect applies, D9 is multiplied by 0.57; if the        *
* upgraded version is equipped, D9 is multiplied by 0.49. *
***********************************************************

12. Damage Limit:
***********************************************************
* If D10 is more than 99,999 and the Damage Limit is not  *
* lifted for this attack, then D11 equals 99,999. Else    *
* D11 equals D10.                                         *
***********************************************************

13. Status Effect: Daze
***********************************************************
* If the Daze status effect is present on the target, D12 *
* equals D11 x 2. The Daze status effect is checked after *
* the Damage Limit condition but I am not certain if this *
* definitely means it can allow an attack to exceed the   *
* damage limit even if it has not met the criteria.       *
***********************************************************

14. Regular Equip ability: Damage rarely becomes 0:
***********************************************************
* If the effect succeeds, D13 becomes 0; else D13 equals  *
* D12.                                                    *
***********************************************************

15. Damage Reduction:
***********************************************************
* D13 is reduced by the absolute damage reducing Chain    *
* Equip abilities. Magical reduction only affects magic   * 
* attacks while physical reduction only affects physical  *
* attacks. The result is D14.                             *
***********************************************************

16. Lower Limit:
***********************************************************
* Take D2L and modify it in the same manner using steps 4 *
* through 15 to obtain the lower limit of damage that     *
* will be dealt to the target: D14L.                      *
***********************************************************

Damage dealt to the target will be a random value between D14L and D14.

It seems as though the game actually chooses a random amount inside of the 
range calculated at step 4 and continues on with that value rather than 
calculating the range and then choosing at random at the end. The easiest way 
to manually calculate the range is to simply apply the random factor at the 
end of the calculation. The more accurate way to calculate the range, 
however, is to apply the random factor at step 4 and calculate the two values 
seperately.



____________________Sample Calculation


Lightning has a base damage of 2040 with the Fight command and has the status 
effect Bravery with a total Commando Role Bonus of 150%. She is attacking an 
enemy with deprotect and a Chain of 200%.

01. There are no applicable effects from Table A; 
    D1 = 2,040

02. Lightning has Bravery; 
    D2 = 2,040 x 1.4 = 2,856

03. The random damage modifier for Fight is 4%; 
    D2L = (1.00 - 0.04) * 2,856 = 2,742

04. The Chain of the enemy is 200%; 
    D3 = 2,856 * 2 = 5,712
    D3L = 2,742 * 2 = 5,484

05. Lightning has an Commando Role Bonus of +150%; 
    D4 = 5,712 * 2.5 = 14,280
    D4L = 5,484 * 2.5 = 13,710

06. Lightning does not have any Enhance Element status effects;
    D5 = 14,280
    D5L = 13,710

07. Lightning does not have the auto-ability Deathblow;
    D6 = 14,280
    D6L = 13,710

08. The target has normal base resistance;
    D7 = 14,280
    D7L = 13,710

09. The target has the status effect deprotect;
    D8 = 14,280 * 1.89 = 26,989
    D8L = 13,710 * 1.89 = 25,912

10. There are no applicable effects from Table E;
    D9 = 26,989
    D9L = 25,912

11. Fringeward does not apply;
    D10 = 26,989
    D10L = 25,912

12. D10 has not exceeded the damage limit;
    D11 = 26,989
    D11L = 25,912

13. The target does not have the status effect Daze;
    D12 = 26,989
    D12L = 25,912

14. The target does not have the ability: Damage rarely become 0;
    D13 = 26,989
    D13L = 25,912

15. The target does not have damage reduction;
    D14 = 26,989
    D14L = 25,912

Total damage dealt equals a random amount between 26,989 and 25,912.



____________________Cut and Keep


Cut and Keep are the ability stats which determine whether or not an attack 
is interrupted. If the Cut value of the attacker's ability is greater than 
the Keep value of the ability of the one receiving the attack then the 
ability is interrupted, otherwise the ability is kept.

Vigilance    - Adds 10 to both the cut and keep of all abilities used by the 
               one inflicted with Vigilance. This will not increase a skill's 
               keep above 89 and skills with a base keep of 90 or greater will 
               have their keep stat remain unaffected.

Curse        - Reduces both the cut and keep of all abilities used by the one 
               inflicted with curse by 20. The lower limit is 0 and skills 
               with a base keep of 90 or greater will have their keep stat 
               remain unaffected.

On a broken opponent, all keep stats which are 89 or less are calculated 
as 0 for the duration of the Stagger.

The keep of any given character not taking an action (eg a character waiting
for their ATB gauge to fill) is 5. This is the base Keep value for all party
members. The base Keep for enemies varies between 5 and 95.



____________________Evasion and Counter

Evade
=====
Upon gaining the auto-ability {Evade} the character will have a chance to 
evade an enemy attack. Evading will be automatically performed when the
character is taking no actions and not being attacked by more than one enemy.
Another way to perform an evasion is to use the command skill [Elude]. These
are the only two ways to evade an attack. Any other time, the Sentinel will
not evade. The item ability {{Improved Evasion}} further improves the skill 
{Evade}. 

The auto ability {Evade} gives a 20% chance to evade attacks. {Evade} will 
only take effect in response to an enemy attack if:

1.  The character is not currently being attacked by a different enemy.
2.  The character is not currently taking an action.
3.  The attack is evadable.

The command skill [Elude] increases the evasion chance percentage by 50 for
as long as the character is using the skill.

{{Improved Evasion}} improves the percentage chance of evasion with the auto-
ability {Evade} by another 10. This will not improve the evasion of [Elude].

Note that only certain attacks can be evaded. If the attack cannot be evaded
then any attempt to evade will always fail.


Counter
=======
After a successful evasion, any character with the auto-ability {Counter} 
will have a 90% chance to retaliate with the command skill [Counter]. Note
that the conditions for {Counter} to activate are the exact same as the
conditions required for {Evade} to activate. As a result, {Counter} will never
activate after an evasion successfully performed by [Elude] because using 
[Elude] counts as "taking an action."

Some abilities cannot be countered even though they can be evaded. In this
case, even if the character successfully evades, {Counter} will never
activate.


Apparent Discrepancies
======================
The auto-ability {Evade} may seem to activate far more often or far less often 
than 20% of the time. The reason {Evade} may seem to activate less often than
20% of the time, as well as the reason it may seem to only be capable of 
dodging the first hit is likely due to the concept of Cut and Keep.

{Evade} can only activate while you are doing nothing. Unfortunately, when you
are doing nothing, your Keep value is 5. Most enemy attacks have a Cut value
greater than 5 so if they hit you with the first hit in a multiple hit attack,
it is very possible they will interrupt any subsequent chances of evasion.

On that same note, {Evade} seems to grant frames of invincibility rather than
just making the attack miss. This could cause any attacks dealt within those
frames of invincibility to miss you regardless of whether or not {Evade} 
actually activated. This seems to be the best explanation for why some 
subsequent hits always seem to miss if you evade the first hit with {Evade}.

None of this is reconciled in the Ultimania so it is mostly due to the
conclusions of myself and Porcupine from extensive testing.

None of these discrepancies are seen in the skill [Elude].
[Elude] has been tested and it works at the percentage stated.



____________________Animation Speed

Each character has a given animation speed for attacks. There is the start
up animation which always begins the attack turn, followed by the 
casting / attacking animation that repeats once for each stock in your 
attack turn.

The speeds for casting RAV, SAB, and COM spells are the same, while the
speed for casting SYN spells is faster and the speed for casting MED spells 
is slower.

Based on multiple tests per character, these are estimates of the relative 
casting speeds for each character. Everyone's speed is displayed relative 
to Vanille. For the sake of estimation, everything was rounded to the nearest 
5%. 

          ________________________________________________
         |           |               ROLES                |
         |           |____________________________________|
         | Character |  MED  |  RAV  / SAB / COM  |  SYN  |
         |===========|=======|====================|=======|
         | Vanille   | 100%  |        100%        | 100%  |
         | Lightning | 110%  |        150%        |  90%  |
         | Fang      | 105%  |        150%        | 100%  |
         | Hope      | 125%  |        115%        | 110%  |
         | Sazh      | 100%  |        110%        |  95%  |
         | Snow      | 145%  |        175%        | 110%  |
         *================================================*


The higher the %, the faster the character can cast the spells of that
Role. So, for instance, Snow can cast MED spells 45% faster than Vanille,
while Hope can cast them 25% faster than Vanille. Lightning, on the other
hand, casts SYN spells at 90% of the speed Vanille casts them, or rather,
10% slower than Vanille. Remember, these percentages are only in comparison
to Vanille, so while Snow is 75% faster at casting RAV spells than Vanille,
he is NOT 25% faster at casting RAV spells than Fang.

If you want to compare Snow to Fang, you would take Snow's percentage and
divide it by Fang's percentage to tell you how much faster Snow can
cast than Fang. In this case: (175% / 150%) = 116% so Snow is ~16% faster
than Fang.





____________________Rise

Certain attacks can cause the target to be launched up into the air. This
can affect party members as well as enemies. An enemy that is launched up
into the air will not be able to take any action until it lands. However,
the enemy's ATB bar will still continue to fill even while in the air; it
just won't be able to act. There are also many enemies that are immune to
being launched up or are only vulnerable while Staggered.

Effects
=======
-The higher the "Rise" value, the higher the target is launched.
-Enemies can only be launched if your Cut value is higher than their Keep.
-The higher an enemy is launched, the longer it will take to come down.
-Attacking a launched enemy will stop their decent back to the ground.
-Any stocked commands become canceled once launched.
-Upon falling to the ground, the target incurs 10 damage.
---This damage can be increased by the COM role bonus.
---This damage can be negated by the SEN role bonus or damage reduction
   accessories.



9. ________________________________________________________________________
[Skills]===================================================================



_____________________Skill Families

Some of the skills belong to a line of skill types. The line to which a 
skill belongs is used primarily for determining which equipment skills 
will affect which action skills. 

For instance, Vanille's weapon skill which increases the chance of success 
for all action skills of the debuffing skill line will not affect the 
success of a skill like Death which is not classified as a debuffing skill.

Siphon       -  The Siphon type skills are the skills with a "draining" 
                property. There is no action skill with this classification.
                Auto Ability: Lifesiphon, Faultsiphon, Fearsiphon
                Equip Ability: Defeat Enemy, recover ATB

Barrier      -  The Barrier type skills are skills which decrease damage.
                Like the Siphon classification, there are no actions skiils
                with the classification: Barrier.
                Auto Ability: Barrier when Critical, Area Barrier

Evade        -  Self explanatory. There are only action skills with the Evade
                classification. They are all listed below.

Provoke      -  These abilities add the provoke property to the enemy which 
                causes the enemy to target that character. Only the Sentinel
                action skills carry this classification.

Counter      -  These are the abilities which have counter properties. In 
                addition to 2 Sentinel action skills the auto ability counter 
                is a counter classification attack.

Guard        -  Self explanatory. There are only action skills with the Guard 
                classification. They are listed below.

Debuffing    -  These are primarily the skills which lower defenses. There 
                are only action skills with the debuffing classification. 
                They are listed below.

Debilitation -  These are primarily the skills which prevent or hinder the 
                actions of the target. There are only action skills with the 
                debilitation classification. They are listed below.

Offense      -  These are primarily the offensive buffs. There are only 
                action skills with the offense classification. They are 
                listed below.

Defense      -  These are primarily the defensive buffs. There are only 
                action skills with the defense classification. They are 
                listed below.

Cure         -  Self explanatory. Note that the skill: raise, does not
                classify as a cure type ability. Although the TP ability 
                Full Cure is classified as a cure type ability, it restores 
                a set amount of life and is unaffected by skills which 
                increase recovery for cure type abilities.
                TP Ability: Full Cure



_____________________Character Specific Skills


Each character has a unique skill which they obtain half way into the 9th 
level of the Crystallium. None of them can be evaded and they all have a cut 
of 50 and a keep of 90. These skills can be used limitlessly but they have 
the following conditions and properties:

   1. They consume the entire ATB Bar.
   2. They ignore type-based defense
   3. They must be input by manual means
   4. Other than Death, each skill has a special effect against a broken 
      target
   5. The Stagger status will not end during the middle of the skill

No matter what size the ATB bar happens to be, the unique skills will take up 
the entire thing. Because they ignore type-based defense, an enemy that is 
immune to physical and magical attacks will still take damage from a unique 
skill. However, this also means that status effects like debrave and deshell 
will have no effect on the damage dealt by a unique skill. 

All unique skills need to be manually input so the AI will never use them. 
Even if the enemy's Stagger gauge duration depletes to 0 during the execution 
of a unique skill, their Stagger status will not end until after the skill has 
been completed. During this time, other characters will also be able to 
continue dealing damage to the enemy.

It should be noted that character specific skills will be completely sealed 
by either the pain or fog status effect. This means that even with a physical 
skill like Lightning's Army of One, it will be completely sealed by a status 
effect like fog which normally only seals magic attacks.


Lightning:
 ____________________________________________________
| Army of One                         Class: Ravager |
|====================================================|
| Type:                    Phys | Target:     Single |
| Damage:              0.3 x 11 | Var:            4% |

|====================================================|
| Stagger Bonus                     Chain: 12.0 x 11 |
*====================================================*

Lightning hits one target 11 times with each hit being calculated seperately.
Note that this means if the skill is used on a broken opponenet, each hit 
will have a successively higher chain bonus to factor into the damage 
calculation.

The chain bonus of this skill is affected by all factors which normally 
affect how much of the chain bonus gauge a skill raises; this includes 
the Ravager role bonus and is calculated on a hit by hit basis.

A broken enemy has their chain gauge resistance reduced to zero so the 
enemy's chain gauge resistance should never factor into the chain gauge 
increase calculation.

| Stagger Bonus                     Chain: 10.0 x 17 |
*====================================================*

Sazh hits one target 17 times with each hit being calculated seperately. 
Note that this means if the skill is used on a broken opponenet, each hit 
will have a successively higher chain bonus to factor into the damage

Snow:
 ____________________________________________________
| Sovereign Fist                     Class: Commando |
|====================================================|
| Type:                    Phys | Target:     Area-S |
| Damage:             2.0 + 0.5 | Var:            4% |
| Chain:                    0.0 | Duration:      0.0 |
|====================================================|
| Stagger Bonus                   Damage: 10.0 + 2.0 |
*====================================================*

Ruler Fist will automatically reset the Chain gauge to 100.00% upon its 
completion. The damage dealt will be calculated first and then after damage 
is dealt, the bar will be reset to 100.00%. This means it will also end a 
Stagger status upon completion.


Hope:
 ____________________________________________________
| Last Resort                         Class: Ravager |
|====================================================|
| Type:                     Mag | Target:    Shuffle |
| Damage:               0.5 x 8 | Var:            9% |
| Chain:                0.0 x 8 | Duration:  0.0 x 8 |
|====================================================|
| Stagger Bonus                      Chain: 20.0 x 8 |
*====================================================*

Hope's unique skill will shuffle through the list of enemies dealing 1 hit to 
each until all hits have been distributed. If there are 4 enemies, each enemy 
will receive 2 hits, but if there are 3 enemies, 2 of them will recieve 3 
hits and the last one will receive only 2 hits.


Fang:
 ____________________________________________________
| Highwind                           Class: Commando |
|====================================================|
| Type:                    Phys | Target:     Area-S |
| Damage: 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 + 0.5 | Var:            4% |
| Chain:                    0.0 | Duration:      0.0 |
|====================================================|
| Stagger Bonus        Damage: 3.0 + 6.0 + 6.0 + 2.0 |
*====================================================*

Highwind will automatically reset the Chain gauge to 100.00% upon its 
completion. The damage dealt will be calculated first and then after damage 
is dealt, the bar will be reset to 100.00%. This means it will also end a 
Stagger status upon completion.

The first two hits of Highwind will often miss targets with a low hitbox 
while the last two hits of Highwind will often miss targets with a high 
hitbox. The large Adamantai-type enemies of Pulse, for instance, will take
more hits when they have collapsed from the loss of both legs than they will
when they are standing up.


Vanille:
 ____________________________________________________
| Death                              Class: Saboteur |
|====================================================|
| Type:                     Mag | Target:     Single |
| Damage:                   4.0 | Var:            9% |
| Chain:                    4.0 | Duration:      0.9 |
|====================================================|
| Added Status Effect:    Death | Chance to add:  1% |
*====================================================*

The base % the death status effect triggering is 1%. That percentage 
increases by 1 for each negative status effect on the target. If Vanille 
targets an enemy with slow, Daze, and Imperil status effects, the base 
percentage of death triggering will increase from 1% to 4%. The 
percentage chance increases in the following manner:

[(Base skill %) * (alteration due to target's resistance)] * (role bonus)

Where the Base skill % is:
[1 + (1 for each negative status effect on the target)]%

Death is affected by any positive resistance to the status effect: Death,
as well as the SAB role bonus. It is not affected by Chain Bonus, nor is
it affected by Improved Debuffing or Improved Debilitation.

Death is the only character specific ability that can gain an elemental
property via the En- status effects. If an enemy is weak to an element
by either the status effect Imperil or just naturally weak to it and 
Death carries the corresponding elemental property, it will deal more
damage.

Death Trick:
------------
It should be noted that I did not come up with this trick and claim
no credit for it.

Death, like all character specific skills, ignores type resistance
(that is physical and magical resistance). It is possible to cast
Death while in the Saboteur role and then switch to the Commando
role before any damage is dealt. By doing this, the damage that Death
deals will actually be based on the Commando role and not the
Saboteur role. This means you can gain the Commando role bonus and
potentially deal a large amount of damage with Death. Because it
also does not reset the chain gauge, it is possible to continue to
deal a high amount of damage over and over. If you have also given
Death an elemental property that the enemy is weak against, it will
deal even more damage.

*(1) -Ra Spells
During Stagger, all -ra spells except for Aerora will increase the chain 
gauge by 25.0 instead of the normal value. Aerora will increase the chain 
gauge by 33.0 during Stagger instead of the normal value.

*(2) Aeroga
Aeroga is actually a 2 hit spell, the initial projectile and the tornado. The 
real damage value is 0.1 + 3.5 while the real chain value is 1.0 + 40.0. The 
rise value is 0 for the projectile and 5 for the tornado.

*(3) Provoke skills
These skills only have a chain value if the status effects take hold on the 
target. In other words, if the target is immune to the status effect or the 
status effect isn't inflicted, the chain value is 0. Likewise, the subsequent 
chain gauge duration is also 0.

*(4) Counter skills
In Fang's case, assuming she is countering a grounded opponent, the damage 
value is 0.45 x 4 and the chain value is 0 + 0 + 0.25 + 0.25.

*(5) Saboteur role skills
Each of these skills adds an additional 5.0 to the chain gauge each time the 
status effect is inflicted. At the same time, it will also add another 8.0 to 
the chain duration. The normal cut property for these skills becomes 25 each 
time the status effect is inflicted.

                    [Blitz]   - Damage = 2.00   Duration =  7.33
                    [Ruinga]  - Damage = 2.45   Duration =  8.33

{Launch}          - Against a staggered enemy the following changes occur:
                    [Attack]  - Rise = 8.0

{Smite}           - Using [Attack] against an enemy that;
                    1. Has been staggered
                    2. Is being attacked mid-air
                    3. Has less than 2.4 seconds remaining of stagger status
                    The following changes occur:
                    [Attack]   - Damage = 5.00  Duration =  0.00
                                 Cut = 50       Keep = 90

{Deathblow}       - If target's remaining HP is less than 1.2 times the damage
                    that would have been dealt, damage will become 1.5 times
                    normal. 
                    For instance, Lightning's attack is going to deal 1000
                    damage against an enemy with 1120 life remaining.
                    Lightning's attack will deal 1500 damage instead.

{Jeopardize)      - When attacking an enemy in stagger status the following
                    change occurs:
                    Chain Bonus Base Modifier increases by 1.0

{Overwhelm}       - For each ally targeting the same enemy the Chain Bonus
                    Base Modifier increases by 1.0

{Fearsiphon}      - Attacking an enemy in staggered status recovers 10% of 1
                    ATB slot.

{Vigor}           - When HP is more than 70% the following change occurs:
                    Chain Bonus Base Modifier increases by 1.0

{Evade}           - Against an attack which can be evaded if the character;
                    1. Is not taking an attack action
                    2. Not being attacked by something else
                    There is a 20% chance to evade the attack

{Counter}         - After successfully evading an attack, the character has 
                    a 90% chance to counter assuming the attack can be
                    countered.

{Deathward}       - When HP is less than 30% the following changes occur:
                    Damage received from physical attacks is reduced by 25%

{Fringeward}      - Any damage allies receive from an attack which primarily
                    targets this character will be reduced to 0.65 times
                    normal damage. This character will still take normal
                    damage. Note that even attacks which hit everyone still
                    target one character. If that character has {Fringeward}
                    the damage received by the other 2 will be reduced.

{Reprieve}        - When HP is more than 30%, if this character receives an 
                    attack which would reduce their life below 0, this 
                    character will survive with 1 HP.

{Jinx}            - When a negative status effect is sucessfully applied to
                    the enemy by this character, any negative status effects
                    already on that enemy will have their remaining length
                    of duration increased by 5 seconds.

{Boon}            - When a positive status effect is sucessfully applied to
                    an ally by this character, any positive status effects

                    of duration increased by 5 seconds.



____________________Recovery Calculation

All recovery spells ignore magic defense and the minimum amount of recovery
is always 1.

Cure:
[Cure] and [Cura] are calculated like a normal damage calculation with 100
added on to the base amount. [Cure] for example would have its base recovery
amount calculated by the following formula:

                    [(MA * 0.2) + 100] = recovery amount

Where 0.2 is the base damage multiplier of [Cure]. [Cura] would have a damage
multiplier of 0.18 instead.

[Curasa] and [Curaja] have slightly different calculations. They are 
calculated based on the amount of HP the targeted ally has lost. Lost HP 
would be equal to the difference between max HP and current HP. The formula 
is as follows:

     (lost HP * Multi) + [(lost HP * MA) / 100,000] = recovery amount

Where "Multi" is equal to the base damage multiplier of the skill used and
"lost HP" is equal to the difference between the max HP and current HP
values of the targeted ally.


Raise:
The standard amount restored by [Raise] is 18% of max HP, however, the Medic
role bonus can boost that amount even further:

 ______________________________
|  Bonus  | Restoration Amount |
|==============================|
|     20% |      21% of max HP |
|  23-26% |      22% of max HP |
|  29-33% |      23% of max HP |
|  35-38% |      24% of max HP |
|  39-44% |      25% of max HP |
|  45-49% |      26% of max HP |
|     52% |      27% of max HP |
*==============================*

If Lightning has the weapon skill {{Raise recovery Up}} the restoration 
percentage of the skill [Raise] is increased by 9. If Lightning has the
upgraded version of this weapon skill {{Raise recovery up II}} the 
recovery amount becomes 36% of max HP regardless of role bonus.


Item recovery:

Potions have a base recovery of 150 HP. If the targeted ally has 3,000 or 
more max HP then the recovery amount becomes 5% of max HP. This amount is
doubled by the accessory {{Medical License}}

Phoenix Downs always restore 70% of max HP upon recovering the ally from
death status. If the ally was not resotored from death status then the 
Phoenix Down does not recover any life.


10. _______________________________________________________________________
[Enemy Data]===============================================================


_____________________Enemy ATB

Enemies have an ATB gauge as well. Unlike the player, enemies can only stock
1 command per turn. Enemy abilities still consume a various number of ATB 
slots however, so this means the enemy will need to spend various amounts of 
time between turns depending on how much of their ATB gauge they need to 
charge.



____________________Libra

There is a hidden Libra statistic for each and every type of enemy in the 
game. Certain conditions or abilities will cause this stat to increase. As the
Libra stat increases, more information will become available on the Libra 
screen. Note that each and every enemy entry in the datalog has their own 
Libra stat.

Libra is broken into 2 different stats:
1. Libra Bonus
2. Libra Consumption

Libra Bonus is the amount of Libra granted by defeating that enemy, using the
TP ability Libra, or using a Librascope. Libra Consumption on the other hand
is the required amount of Libra to unlock the next piece of information on
the Libra screen. Unlocking everything will take, at most, 503 Libra points.

The following chart lists the conditions for obtaining Libra:

 _________________________________________________________
| Condition                                 | Libra Bonus |
|=========================================================|
| Party member defeats that type of enemy   |  (varies)   |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| A party member attacks or adds a status   |             |
| effect to that type of enemy with a fully |      5      |
| stocked ATB gauge.                        |             |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Use the TP ability Libra                  |     200     |
|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Use the item Librascope                   |    1000     |

*============================================================================*

Each item in the table above is obtained in chronological order. Each step
consumes the listed amount of Libra. Therefore, it actually costs 170 Libra 
to go from number 1 to number 12. The two steps tagged with **  are only 
applicable in Eidolon battles so they were not included in the step numbering. 
Against Eidolons however, these two steps fall in the order listed above
instead of their normal positioning.

If you fulfill the "other methods" condition before this step is revealed
via Libra then this step will be taken out and no longer consume Libra. For
instance, if you obtain an item drop from an enemy before you unlock Note
4 then Rare Item Drop will become the next step after Note 4.

The steps which list (Nothing) cannot be circumvented. They will simply
consume 5 Libra for nothing.



____________________Enemy List

This is meant as a reference list for enemy skills, resistances, and stats. I
will not list every enemy in the game as that is a job for an Enemy FAQ. At
present, I only plan to list the Marks, Chapter Bosses, and a few others.

Certain enemies have 2 disinct sets of stats or resistances. This is beacause
enemy conditions can change their stats and even the set of skills which they
can use. The final boss, for instance, has 2 different states, which it 
switches between every 2.5 minutes or so, and has different skills in each
state. Tortoise enemies have their resistances changed when they collapse. 
Just to name a few instances.

Enemy skills can often bear the same name as a player skill and not actually
have the same damage properties. For instance, the Long Gui's Quake spell has
a damage multiplier of 1.0 instead of the normal 2.2

The source of the information is in Japanese so with some of the skills which
are either not mentioned in the English guide or are not labeled in-game, I 
will simply translate or transliterate the Japanese instead.

| - | During this battle, Bart will acquire up to 4 different "Parts". These |
|   | "Parts" behave much like in the first battle with Bart except this time|
|   | it is impossible to target his Parts.                                  |
|   | Nevertheless, they will take turns and will use attacks against your   |
|   | party. Each of the Parts is level 51 and has 275 PA and MA. The only   |
|   | attacks they use are the Laser abilities as labeled.                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - | As time progresses and as Bart takes damage, he will gain 2 Parts, then|
|   | he will gain 2 more to make 4 total Parts, then he will reveal his     |
|   | face. At this time, he will enter B Status.                            |

|   | 2nd and 3rd use = Charges for 5 seconds before using the attack        |
|   |                   While charging, the wind attack occurs               |
|   |                   The wind attack hits once                            |

|   | Adds: Brave, Faith, Haste, Veil (each for 120s)                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 7 | The MA value used to calculate damage for this attack is 683.          |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8 | Casts Death Sentence on your leader (420s).                            |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - | Except during Stagger, Orphan will use [Time Wasted] every 70 secs to  |
|   | reset any progress you make in raising the Chain Gauge.                |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - | Casts Death Sentence on your leader after 30 mins have passed from the |
|   | start of the battle.                                                   |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| - | Even though Orphan is level 51, the enemy level value used to calculate|
|   | the battle result is 102. This is to give you a higher chance at       |
|   | achieving a 5 star result.                                             |
|   |                                                                        |
|   | At least this is what the Ultimania says; however, by my calculations, |
|   | the game actually does treat his level as 51 in the battle result.     |
|   | Otherwise the Target Time would typically be over 40 mins. I've found  |
|   | no other way to reconcile this than to assume that the game is not     |
|   | treating his level as 102 when it calculates Target Time.              |

| 1 | This is only the damage dealt by the shockwave. The leg also deals     |
|   | damage: Trg = Area-F  Multi = 1.2  Var = 9%.  The left leg varies      |
|   | slightly: C = 50  Var = ~18%.  Mid-air targets will not be hit by the  |
|   | the shockwave.                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | Anyone who is close enough to the leg will take additional damage as   |
|   | detailed above. The shockwave from this attack targets 1 character and |
|   | hits the rest as "splash" damage. The character who is targeted will   |
|   | feel a "knockback" effect and will activate {Fringeward} if they can.  |

| 5 | Damage dealt automatically to any within range upon collapsing.        |
