I.  INTRODUCTION

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is my attempt at creating a FF3j damage formula that can predict how much 
damage will be done from various attacks within the game.  Note that I'm NOT 
an employee at Square nor have access to their source code or algorithms.  All 
formulas in this FAQ were derived from experimental observations done by me.  
This means that although I've done quite a lot of carefully set up experiments 
to be very confident with the results in this FAQ, I by no means guarantee 
that everything is absolutely 100% correct, nor do I disclude the possibility 
that I have may missed some things.  If you do notice any discrepancies, 
errors, omissions, etc. or have any suggestions or comments, please send your 
feedback to instructrtrepe@hotmail.com, or post at the FF3j message board at 
http://www.gamefaqs.com

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

II.  CREDITS AND ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the FF3j message board at http://www.gamefaqs.com, I'd like to thank Sir 
Bahamut for all his feedback and help and sqpat17 for finding and posting the 
hex offset data for the FF3j rom.

Using sqpat17's hex offset data, I extracted the hex data from the rom myself 
to create my own data tables, but FAQ's and guides that I used as references 
to verify my own data:

lordskylark's extended Ff3j monster list at 
http://www.geocities.com/lord_skylark
cidolfas's FF3j shrine at http://www.rpgclassics.com/shrines/nes/ff3/
BSiron's FFII (US) FAQ at http://www.gamefaqs.com

FF3j actually shares a lot of similar damage formula mechanics as FFIV, so 
BSiron's FAQ for FFII(US) provided an excellent starting point for my FAQ.

My emulator of choice for this game is VirtuaNES at

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IV.  BRIEF OVERVIEW OF FAQ CONTENTS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Section VI contains a glossary and explanation of all the terms I've used in 
this FAQ.

Sections VII and VIII contain a brief overview and summary of the damage 
calculation formula and the various effects of commands, spells, elemental and 
status effects.  If you want a general understanding of how damage is 
calculated, these are the sections you want to read.

Sections IX, X and XI provide detailed steps on the damage calculation formula 
for character attacks, monster attacks and magic attacks.  They essentially 
take the information in Sections VII and VIII and explicitly state all the 
Steps that would occur for each type of attack.

Section XII is the data reference section.  It contains weapon, armour, skill, 
magic and enemy magic data that is used in the damage calculation formula.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

V.  NOTES

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This game uses integer values.  Therefore after every division shown in any 
formula in this FAQ, immediately round down before proceeding with any further 
calculation.

Due to the way Level and Skill are stored internally in the game, all 
references to Skill and Level in this FAQ actually refer to one minus the 
value that is displayed in the game.  For example, at the start of New Game, 
all characters begin at Level 0 and Skill 0 for calculation purposes of this 
FAQ.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VI.  GLOSSARY AND DEFINITIONS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Just so everyone's on the same page in terms of terminology and for those who 
may be unfamiliar with some the stats in FF3j, here's a list of stats that are 
used in this FAQ.

LEVEL:   Character level.  This is displayed in the game character status 
screen as "Level".  As you increase in level, your main stats (Strength, 
Agility, Vitality, Intellect, Spirit) increase as well as your HP and MP.  
Level affects your Attack Multiplier, Defense Multiplier and your Magic Attack 
Multiplier, as well as Steal Rate.  The difference between your level and 
monster level affects whether an enemy will run from you, the chances of 
getting "First Strike" or "Ambushed" and whether the Kill spell has a chance 
of succeeding.  Monsters also have a Level stat.  In their case, however, 
Level only affects Magic Attack Multiplier.

SKILL:  The character's Skill level for his current job. This is displayed in 
the game character status screen as "Skill".  Skill points are earned in 
battle and are recorded separately for each job for every character.  Skill 
affects your Attack Damage, Hit%, Magic Attack Multiplier and Steal rate.  It 
also lowers the amount of Capacity points required to change into that job.  
Monsters also have a Skill stat.  In their case, however, Skill only affects 
Magic Attack Multiplier.

STRENGTH:  The character's Strength, displayed in the game character status 
screen as "Strength".  Strength affects your Attack Damage.

AGILITY:  The character's Agility, displayed in the game character status 
screen as "Agility".  Agility affects your Hit%, Attack Multiplier and Magic 
Defense Multiplier.

VITALITY: The character's Vitality, displayed in the game character status 
screen as "Vitality".  Vitality affects your Defense.  Jobs with high Vitality 
also get a higher HP gain on levelling up.

INTELLECT: The character's Intellect, displayed in the game character status 
screen as "Intellect".  Intellect affects your Black Magic Attack Damage, Call 
Magic Attack Damage, Black Magic Hit%, Call Magic Hit%, Black Magic Attack 
Multiplier, Call Magic Attack Multiplier, Magic Evade% and Magic Defense 
Multiplier.  Monsters also have an Intellect stat.  In their case, however, 
Intellect does not affect Magic Evade% nor Magic Defense Multiplier.

SPIRIT: The character's Spirit, displayed in the game character status screen 
as "Spirit".  Spirit affects your White Magic Attack Damage, White Magic Hit%, 
White Magic Attack Multiplier, Magic Evade% and Magic Defense Multiplier.  
Monsters also have a Spirit stat.  In their case, however, Spirit does not 
affect Magic Evade% nor Magic Defense Multiplier.

ATTACK DAMAGE:  The base amount of damage a character will do when attacking 
physically.  This is displayed in the game character status screen to the 
right of "Att. ?X ", parallel to the Strength stat.  If a character has a 
weapon in both hands, the Attack Damage shown on the status screen is the sum 
of the Attack Damages of each hand.  The formula for Attack Damage is:

Attack Damage = (Weapon Damage) + (Strength/4)

Monsters also have an Attack Damage stat.  In their case, however, they do not 
follow the above formula and have their own specified value.

ATTACK MULTIPLIER:  The maximum number times a character can hit in one 
physical attack command.  This is displayed in the game character status 
screen right after "Att.", to the left of the Attack Damage stat.  If a 
character has a weapon in both hands, the Attack Multiplier shown on the 
status screen is the sum of the Attack Multipliers of each hand.  The formula 
for Attack Multiplier is:

Attack Multiplier = (Agility/16) + (Level/16) + 1

Monsters also have an Attack Multiplier stat.  In their case, however, they do 
not follow the above formula and have their own specified value.

HIT%: The chance a character has to land a hit.  This is displayed in the game 
character status screen as "Hit %".  If a character has a weapon in both 
hands, the Hit% shown on the status screen is the average of the Hit% of each 
hand.  The formula for Hit% is:

Hit% = (Weapon Hit%) + (Agility/4) + (Skill/4)

Monsters also have a Hit% stat.  In their case, however, they do not follow 
the above formula and have their own specified value.

DEFENSE:  The amount of damage that any physical attack made on the character 
will be reduced by. This is displayed in the game character status screen to 
the right of "Def. ?X ", parallel to the Agility stat.  The formula for 
Defense is:

Defense = sum of all worn (Armour Defense) + (Vitality/2)

Monsters also have a Defense stat.  In their case, however, they do not follow 
the above formula and have their own specified value.

DEFENSE MULTIPLIER:  The maximum number of hits a character can avoid from a 
physical attack made on that character.  This is displayed in the game 
character status screen right after "Def.", to the left of the Defense stat.  
The formula for Defense Multiplier is:

(with shield):

Defense Multiplier = (Agility/16) + (Level/16) + 1 * (number of shields
                     equipped)

(without shield):

Defense Multiplier = (Agility/32) + (Level/32)

Monsters also have a Defense Multiplier stat.  In their case, however, they do 
not follow the any of the above formulas and have their own specified value.

EVADE%:  The chance a character has to evade a hit.  This is displayed in the 
game character status screen as "Evade".  The formula for Evade% is:

Evade% = sum of all worn (Armour Evade%) + (Agility/4)

Monsters also have an Evade% stat.  In their case, however, they do not follow 
the above formula and have their own specified value.

MAGIC DEFENSE: The amount of damage that any magic attack made on the 
character will be reduced by. This is displayed in the game character status 
screen as "M. Def.".  The formula for Magic Defense is:

Magic Defense = sum of all worn (Armour Magic Defense)

Monsters also have a Magic Defense stat.  In their case, however, they do not 
follow the above formula and have their own specified value.

MAGIC EVADE%: The chance a character has to evade a magic hit.  This is 
displayed in the game character status screen as "M. Evade".  The formula for 
Magic Evade% is:

Magic Evade% = (Intellect/2) + (Spirit/2)

Monsters also have a Magic Evade% stat.  In their case, however, they do not 
follow the above formula and have their own specified value.

MAGIC ATTACK MULTIPLIER:  The maximum number times a character can hit in one 
magic attack command.  This is not displayed anywhere in the game.  The number 
of hits that succeed are not shown in battle either, only the final resulting 
magic damage.  There are three different types of magic, and thus three 
different formulas for Magic Attack Multiplier:

Black Magic Attack Multiplier = (Intellect/16) + (Level/16) + (Skill/32) + 1

White Magic Attack Multiplier = (Spirit/16) + (Level/16) + (Skill/32) + 1

Call Magic Attack Multiplier = (Intellect/8) + (((Skill/8)*3)/2) + 1

Monsters use the same formulas shown above when attacking with magic.

MAGIC HIT%:  The chance a character has to land a magic hit.  This is not 
displayed anywhere in the game.  There are three different types of magic, and 
thus three different formulas for Magic Hit%:

Black Magic Hit% = (Spell Hit%) + (Intellect/2)
 
White Magic Hit% = (Spell Hit%) + (Spirit/2)

Call Magic Hit% = (Spell Hit%) + (Intellect)

Monsters use the same formulas shown above when attacking with magic.

MAGIC ATTACK DAMAGE:  The base amount of damage a character will do when 
attacking with magic.  This is not displayed anywhere in the game.  There are 
four different formulas for Magic Attack Damage:

Black Magic Attack Damage = (Spell Damage) + (Intellect/2)

For offensive White spells (Holy, Aero2, Aero):
White Magic Attack Damage = (Spell Damage) + (Spirit/2)

For non-offensive White spells (Cure4, Cure3, Cure2, Cure, Haste, Safe):
White Magic Attack Damage = (Spell Damage) 

Call Magic Attack Damage = (Spell Damage) + (Intellect)

Monsters use the same formulas shown above when attacking with magic.

MAGIC DEFENSE MULTIPLIER:  The maximum number of hits a character can avoid 
from a magic attack made on that character.  This is not displayed anywhere in 
the game.  The formula for Magic Defense Multiplier is:

Magic Defense Multiplier = (Agility/32) + (Intellect/32) + (Spirit/32)
 
Monsters also have a Magic Defense Multiplier stat.  In their case, however, 
they do not follow the above formula and have their own specified value.

WEAPON DAMAGE:  The Attack Damage of the equipped weapon.  Each weapon has 
their own Weapon Damage value (see Weapon Data).

WEAPON HIT%:  The Hit% of the weapon equipped.  Each weapon has their own 
Weapon Hit% value (see Weapon Data).

ARMOUR DEFENSE:  The Defense of the armour equipped.  Each armour has their 
own Armour Defense value (see Armour Data).

ARMOUR EVADE%: The Evade% of the armour equipped.  Each armour has their own 
Armour Evade% value (see Armour Data).

ARMOUR MAGIC DEFENSE:  The Magic Defense of the armour equipped.  Each armour 
has their own Armour Magic Defense value (see Armour Data).

SPELL DAMAGE:  The Magic Attack Damage of that spell.  Each spell has their 
own Spell Damage value (see Magic Data).

SPELL HIT%:  The Magic Hit% of that spell.  Each spell has their own Spell 
Hit% value (see Magic Data).

ITEM MAGIC ATTACK MULTIPLIER:  When items are used, they essential cast the 
spell that is associated with it.  Items use their own Magic Attack Multiplier, 
though (see Item Data).

ITEM MAGIC HIT%:  When items are used, they essential cast the spell that is 
associated with it.  Items always have a Magic Hit% of 100.

BLACK MAGIC:  Magic spells usable by the Black Wizard, Red Wizard, Warlock and 
Sage.  Also, for damage calculation purposes, all Terrain commands used by the 
Geomancer are considered Black magic.

WHITE MAGIC:  Magic spells usable by the White Wizard, Red Wizard, Hunter, 
Mystic Knight, Shaman and Sage.  Note that there is a different Magic Attack 
Damage formula for offensive White magic (Holy, Aero2, Aero) and non-offensive 
White magic (Cure4, Cure3, Cure2, Cure, Haste, Safe).  Also, Toad, Mini, Life 
and Life2 have a Magic Hit% of 100 when cast on a party member.  When cast on 
an enemy, the Magic Hit% listed in the Magic Data section is used.

CALL MAGIC:  Magic spells usable by the Conjurer, Summoner and Sage.

VULNERABLE STATE:  There can be times when a character becomes vulnerable.  In 
these cases, the character's Defense, and Defense Multiplier become zero and 
they also receive double damage from physical attacks.  Vulnerable states 
include becoming Toad, Mini, and immediately after executing a 'Buildup' 
command until just prior to a subsequent 'Fight' or 'Overload'.  In addition, 
if ANY character in the party chooses the 'Run' or 'Escape' command, then ALL 
party members become vulnerable for the entire round.  

In the case Buildup, Toad or Mini, the character's Magic Defense also becomes 
zero and they will also receive double damage from magic attacks.  They will 
not, however, receive double healing from White magic.  Also, in the case of 
Toad and Mini, the character's Magic Defense Multiplier will also become zero.

ATTACKER:  The one that is initiating an action command.  An action command 
can be either 'Fight', 'Magic', 'Item', 'Jump', 'Sing'.  In the damage 
calculation formulas, the stats Attack Damage, Attack Multiplier, Hit%, Magic
Attack Damage, Magic Hit%, Magic Attack Multiplier all refer to the attacker's 
stats.

TARGET:  The target of the attacker's action command.  Most actions allow the 
attacker to choose a target.  Some allow the attacker to attack all targets.  
Some will automatically target all enemies or all allies.  In the damage 
calculation formulas, the stats Defense, Defense Multiplier, Evade%, Magic 
Defense, Magic Defense Multiplier, Magic Evade% all refer to the target's 
stats.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VII.  DAMAGE CALCULATION FORMULA:  BRIEF GENERAL FORMULA

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The damage calculation formula is essentially the same regardless of what type 
of attack is made or who the attacker or target is.  The following is a very 
brief overview of how damage is calculated from an attack.  For magic attacks, 
use the appropriate magic stats.

**************************
NOTATION AND ABBREVIATIONS
**************************
(x..y)    Refers to a uniformly distributed random number between x and y
          inclusive.
M         Net Attack Multiplier

************************
DAMAGE CALCULATION STEPS
************************

1) CALCULATE BASE DAMAGE
      Base Damage = Attack Damage

2) APPLY BASE DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
      Base Damage = (Base Damage + (additive bonuses)) * (multiplicative bonuses
                    or penalties)

3) APPLY RANDOM RANGE TO BASE DAMAGE
      Base Damage = (Base Damage..Base Damage*1.5)

4) SUBTRACT TARGET'S DEFENSE
      Base Damage = Base Damage - Defense

5) CALCULATE NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
      M (on average) ~= ((Attack Multiplier) * Hit%) - ((Defense Multiplier) *
                        Evade%)

6) MULTIPLY BASE DAMAGE BY NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
      Final Damage = Base Damage * M

7) APPLY FINAL DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
      Final Damage = Final Damage * (bonuses or penalties)

8) DUAL WIELDING OR MULTIPLE TARGETS
      Repeat Steps 1-7 for each weapon in each hand.
      Repeat Steps 1-7 for each target.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

VIII. DAMAGE CALCULATION FORMULA:  BONUSES AND PENALTIES REFERENCE

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For easy reference, here is a list of commands, spells etc. and a summary of 
their effects in the damage calculation formula.

***********
1) COMMANDS
***********

1.1) DEFEND
Immediately after a character executes a 'Defend' command, he will receive a 
bonus against physical attacks.  This bonus only lasts until the end of the 
current round.

Defense = Defense * 4

This bonus is applied in Step 4.

1.2) TERRAIN
A Geomancer's 'Terrain' commands are considered Black Magic.  The same 
formulas that pertain to Black Magic are also used for Terrain, namely:

Magic Damage = (Spell Damage) + (Intellect/2)
Magic Hit% = (Spell Hit%) + (Intellect/2)
Magic Attack Multiplier = (Intellect/16) + (Level/16) + 1

One important difference, though, is that if the Geomancer misses all targets 
(i.e. M (calculated from Step 5) = 0 for ALL targets) then instead of an 
'Ineffective' message, you get a 'Backfired' message.  The Geomancer also 
subsequently sustains (MAX HP)/4 damage.

1.3) JUMP
If a Dragoon is landing an attack from a 'Jump' command:

Final Damage = Final Damage * 3

This bonus is applied in Step 7.

1.4) BUILDUP
The Karateka's 'Buildup' command has three basic effects:  a bonus to Final 
Damage, a penalty to the Karateka's Defense, Defense Multiplier and Magic 
Defense, and finally, the Karateka receives double damage (but not double 
healing) whenever he is the target of a physical or magic attack.

If a Karateka has executed one 'Buildup' command prior to the current attack, 
then:

Final Damage = Final Damage * 2

If a Karateka has executed two 'Buildup' commands prior to the current attack, 
then:

Final Damage = Final Damage * 3

Note that immediately after a Karateka executes a third 'Buildup' command 
without a 'Fight' command, then an 'Overload' occurs and the current attack is 
aborted and HP = (Current HP)/2

These bonuses are applied in Step 7.

Immediately after a Karateka has executed a 'Buildup' command and just prior 
to a subsequent 'Fight' or 'Overload', becomes vulnerable and has the 
following penalties: 

Defense = 0
Defense Multiplier = 0

In addition the Karateka receives a penalty to his Magic Defense:

Magic Defense = 0

These penalties are applied in Steps 4 and 5.

Also during this period, whenever the Karateka is the target of a physical or 
magic attack, that attacker receives a bonus to Base Damage.  Non-offensive 
White magic spells (i.e. healing), however, do not receive this bonus:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2 (not for non-offensive White magic)

This bonus is applied in Step 2 for the one attacking the Karateka.

1.5) SCARE
Each use the Bard's 'Scare' command reduces all enemies' levels:

Enemy level = Enemy level - 3

Multiple uses of 'Scare' can eventually lead to enemies running away instead 
of attacking in battle.  An enemy will only run away if:

(Lowest character level) - (Enemy level) > 15

If the above condition is met, then the chance that a monster will choose to 
Run will be:

%Chance to Run = 100 - Monster Hit%

Also note that as an enemy level is decreased there is also the potential of 
reducing its Magic Attack Multiplier.

Bosses are immune to 'Scare' and will also never attempt to Run.

1.6) CHEER
Each use of the Bard's 'Cheer' command gives an additive bonus to physical 
Base Damage for each party member:
Base Damage = Base Damage + 10 (for physical attacks only)

This bonus is applied in Step 2.

1.7) RUN AND ESCAPE
If a character chooses the 'Run' or 'Escape' command, then for that entire 
round, ALL party members will be in a vulnerable state and receive the 
following defensive penalties:

Defense = 0
Defense Multiplier = 0

These penalties are applied in Steps 4 and 5.

Anyone attacking any of the party members will also receive a bonus to Base 
Damage for physical attacks:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2 (for physical attacks only)

This bonus is applied in Step 2 for the one attacking the party member.

Note that monsters that attempt to Run receive NO penalties and party members 
that attack monsters that attempt to Run receive no bonuses.

1.8) ITEM
Using an item is essentially the same as casting the spell that is associated 
with that item.  The damage calculation formula is same for items as it is for 
magic attacks. There are, however, two important differences:

i)  Items have their own Magic Attack Multiplier.  This is not influenced by 
any of the attacker's stats.

ii)  Items have their Magic Hit% of 100. This is also not influenced by any of 
the attacker's stats, nor is it affected by Blind.

In general, all weapons that can be used to cast spells have a Magic Attack 
Multiplier of one.  Most other items have a Magic Attack Multiplier of three.

*********
2) SPELLS
*********

2.1) HASTE
Although Haste doesn't appear to cause or heal any damage, it does have a 
Spell Damage value.  When someone casts Haste, apply Steps 1-6 to calculate M 
and Final Damage for Haste.  The target of the Haste spell then receives a 
bonus to his Attack Multiplier and Base Damage:

Base Damage = Base Damage + (Final Damage calculated from Haste)
A.M = A.M. + (M calculated from Haste)

The Base Damage bonus is applied in Step 2 for the Hasted target.
The Attack Multiplier is applied in Step 5 for the Hasted target.

Note that the maximum value for Base Damage is 255 and the maximum value for 
A.M. is 16.  If the target already has a maximum value in either Base Damage 
of A.M., then the Haste spell becomes 'Ineffective'.

2.2) SAFE
Although Safe doesn't appear to cause or heal any damage, it does have a Spell 
Damage value.  When someone casts Safe, apply Steps 1-6 to calculate Final 
Damage for Safe.  The target of the Safe spell then receives a bonus to his 
Defense and Magic Defense:

Defense = Defense + (Final Damage calculated from Safe)
Magic Defense = Magic Defense + (Final Damage calculated from Safe)

These bonuses are applied in Step 4 for the Safe target.

Note that the maximum value for Defense or Magic Defense is 255.  If the 
target already has a maximum value in either Defense or Magic Defense, then 
the Safe spell becomes 'Ineffective'.

2.3) KILL
The Kill spell follows the normal Magic Hit% formulas like all other spells, 
but with one major difference.  The Kill spell will not work at all against 
targets whose levels are too high, relative to the caster.

IF Target Level >= ((((Attacker Level)/2)*3)/2)
Magic Hit% = 0

This penalty is applied in Step 5

2.4) CURE4
If Cure4 is cast on a single target, that target fully heals his HP.  If Cure4 
is cast on multiple targets, use Steps 1-8 normally to calculate the amount 
cured.

2.5) TOAD, MINI, LIFE, LIFE2
When these spells are cast on a party member, their Magic Hit% is 100.  If 
they are cast on an enemy, use the normal Magic Hit% formula.

2.6) OFFENSIVE AND NON-OFFENSIVE WHITE SPELLS
Offensive and non-offensive White spells have different formulas for Magic 
Damage:

Offensive White spells:
White Magic Attack Damage = (Spell Damage) + (Spirit/2)

Non-offensive White spells:
White Magic Attack Damage = (Spell Damage) 

Offensive White spells include Holy, Aero2 and Aero.  Non-offensive White 
spells include Cure4, Cure3, Cure2, Haste and Safe.

Note that the non-offensive formula still applies to the Cure spells, even if 
they are used to inflict damage against the undead.

2.7) AUTO-TARGETTING SPELLS
Normally, when you choose to cast a spell against multiple targets, Final 
Damage receives a penalty:

Final Damage = (Final Damage)/(# of targets selected)

This penalty is applied in Step 7.

Some spells however, will automatically target all enemies or all allies.  
These spells do not receive the above penalty.  Spells that automatically 
target all enemies include Quake, Meteo, some Terrain spells and all Call
spells cast by a Summoner or Sage.  Enemy magic that automatically targets
all party members include Flame, Blizzard, Thunder, Tsunami, Flarewave, Atom
Edge, Poison, Mindblast and Megaflare.

2.8) WALL
A successful casting of Wall on a target creates a barrier in front of that 
target.  The next time an enemy targets that character with a magic attack, 
the spell is redirected back to an enemy party member.  For damage 
calculation purposes, the formulas, bonuses and penalties are the same as if 
the caster had self-targeted himself or his party member with that spell.  
After reflecting one spell, the effects of Wall cease.  Only one Wall may be 
in effect for one character at a time.  Multiple castings of Wall on the same 
target have no effect.  Wall does not reflects spells that were cast by their 
own party member (i.e. you may still heal someone with Wall).  Only certain 
Black, White and Enemy magic spells may be reflected (see Magic Data).

2.9) WWIND
A successful casting of WWind on a target reduces that target's HP to (Spell 
Damage..Spell Damage * 2).  Note that in this case, Final Damage in Step 6 is 
not used and M from Step 5 is used only to check for spell success.

********************
3) ELEMENTAL EFFECTS
********************

3.1) ELEMENTAL WEAKNESS
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is weak 
against at least one of those elements, then the target will be considered 
weak.  If the target is weak against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2

This bonus is applied in Step 2.

3.2) ELEMENTAL STRENGTH
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is strong 
against at least one of those elements and is not weak against any of those 
elements, then the target will be considered strong.  If the target is strong 
against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage / 2

This bonus is applied in Step 2.

*****************
4) STATUS EFFECTS
*****************

4.1) BLIND
An attacker that is 'Blind' receives a penalty to his Hit% and Magic Hit%.  
Note that Item Magic Hit% is not affected by Blind.

Hit% = (Hit%/2)
Magic Hit% = (Magic Hit%/2)

These penalties are applied in Step 5.

4.2) TOAD AND MINI
If a character that is Toad or Mini makes a physical attack:

Base Damage = 0 (for physical attacks only)

This penalty is applied in Step 2.  This penalty supersedes every other bonus 
in Step 2 (i.e. a Hasted or Cheered Toad still only does 1 damage).  The other 
bonuses are still recorded and in the event that the character recovers from 
Toad or Mini, he will be restored to the new improved Base Damage.

A Toad or Mini character is in a vulnerable state.  Whenever a Toad or Mini 
character is the target of an attack:

Defense = 0
Defense Multiplier = 0

In addition, a Toad or Mini character also has a penalty to Magic Defense and 
Magic Defense Multiplier:

Magic Defense = 0
Magic Defense Multiplier = 0

These penalties are applied in Steps 4 and 5.

The one attacking the Toad or Mini character also receives a bonus to Base 
Damage.  Non-offensive White magic spells (i.e. healing), however, do not 
receive this bonus:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2 (not for non-offensive White magic)

This bonus is applied in Step 2 for the one attacking the Toad or Mini 
character.

4.3) BACK ROW
OK, not exactly a status effect, but it is a state of being.  Anyway, an 
attacker that makes a physical attack to or from the back row receives a 
penalty to Hit%:

Hit% = (Hit%/2)

This penalty is applied in Step 5.

**************
MINIMUM DAMAGE
**************

As long as you connect with at least one hit (i.e. M > 0 in Step 5), then the 
Final Damage will always be at least one.

IF (M > 0) and (Final Damage <= 0)
Final Damage = 1

This is applied in Step 7.

***************
SELF-TARGETTING
***************

If you target your own party member with a physical attack then that target 
receives penalty to its Defense:

Defense = 0

This penalty is applied in Step 4.

If you target your own party member with a magic attack, then that target 
receives the following penalties:

Magic Defense = 0
Magic Defense Multiplier = 0

These penalties are applied in Step 4.

IX. DAMAGE CALCULATION FORMULA:  CHARACTER PHYSICAL ATTACKS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are detailed steps for calculating damage when a character uses 
a physical attack.  These steps are all cumulative, calculated in the 
following order:

************************
1) CALCULATE BASE DAMAGE
************************

Base Damage = Weapon Base + (Strength/4) + (Skill/4)

******************************************
2) APPLY BASE DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
******************************************

2.1) BASE DAMAGE ADDITIVE BONUSES

2.1.1) HASTE SPELL
Attackers that have had Haste cast on them get an additive bonus for physical 
attacks.  This bonus is equal to the calculated Final Damage from the caster's 
Haste spell (via Steps 1-6).

Base Damage = Base Damage + (Final Damage calculated from Haste)

2.1.2) CHEER COMMAND
Each use of the Bard's 'Cheer' command gives an additive bonus to physical 
Base Damage for each party member:

Base Damage = Base Damage + 10

2.2) BASE DAMAGE MULTIPLICATIVE BONUSES

2.2.1) ELEMENTAL WEAKNESS
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is weak 
against at least one of those elements, then the target will be considered 
weak.  If the target is weak against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2

2.2.2) VULNERABLE TARGET
Vulnerable states include being a Frog, Mini, immediately after executing a 
'Buildup' command and just prior to a subsequent 'Fight' or 'Overload', and 
also during the entire round when the target or any of its party members 
attempt to Run or Escape. If the target of the attack is in a vulnerable 
state:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2 

Note the above vulnerable conditions can only apply to party members.  This 
bonus is only applied to a character that targets his own party member that is 
vulnerable.

2.3) BASE DAMAGE MULTIPLICATIVE PENALTIES

2.3.1) ELEMENTAL STRENGTH
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is strong 
against at least one of those elements and is not weak against any of those 
elements, then the target will be considered strong.  If the target is strong 
against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage / 2

2.3.2) TOAD OR MINI
If the attacker is Toad or Mini then:

Base Damage = 0 

Note that this penalty supersedes every other bonus list above.  However, 
bonuses are still remembered and in the event that the target recovers from 
Toad or Mini status, he will be restored to the new, higher Base Damage value.

************************************
3) APPLY RANDOM RANGE TO BASE DAMAGE
************************************

Apply a random range to the Base Damage:

Base Damage = (Base Damage..Base Damage*1.5)

****************************
4) SUBTRACT TARGET'S DEFENSE
****************************

The target's defense value will reduce the Base Damage of the attack.

4.1) INITIAL DEFENSE VALUE

4.1.1) MONSTER DEFENSE
Against physical attacks, Monsters have their own Defense stat (referenced via 
a lookup table):

Defense = Monster Defense

4.1.2) SELF-TARGETTING
If the attacker is targeting a party member:

Defense = 0

4.2) DEFENSE BONUSES

4.2.1) SAFE SPELL
Targets that have had Safe cast on them get an additive bonus.  This bonus is 
equal to the calculated Final Damage from the caster's Safe spell (via Steps 
1-6).

Defense = Defense + (Final Damage calculated from Safe)

4.3) BASE DAMAGE CALCULATION 
Subtract the target's Defense value from the attacker's base Damage:

Base Damage = Base Damage - Defense

**********************************
5) CALCULATE NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
**********************************

A.M. = Attack Multiplier
D.M. = Defense Multiplier
M = Net Attack Multiplier

5.1) ATTACK MULTIPLIER

5.1.1) INITIAL VALUE OF ATTACK MULTIPLIER

A.M. = (Agility/16) + (Level/16) + 1

5.1.2) ATTACK MULTIPLIER BONUSES

5.1.2.1) HASTE SPELL
Attackers that have had Haste cast on them get an additive bonus for physical 
attacks.  This bonus is equal to the calculated Net Multiplier from the 
caster's Haste spell (via Step 5).  Note that A.M. has a maximum value of 16.  
If Haste is cast on a target that already has an A.M. of 16, then the spell 
will be ineffective (the target will NOT receive a damage bonus).

A.M. = A.M. + (M calculated from Haste)

5.2) HIT%

5.2.1) INITIAL VALUE OF HIT%
Note that Hit% has a maximum value of 99.  This maximum limit is applied 
BEFORE applying any Hit% penalties.

Hit% = Weapons Base Hit% + (Agility/4) + (Skill/4)

5.2.2) HIT% PENALTIES

5.2.2.1) BACK ROW
For physical attacks, if attacking to or from the back row:

Hit% = Hit%/2 

5.2.2.2) BLIND STATUS
If the attacker is Blind:

Hit% = Hit%/2

5.3) DEFENSE MULTIPLIER

5.3.1) INITIAL VALUE OF DEFENSE MULTIPLIER

5.3.1.1) MONSTER DEFENSE MULTIPLIER
Against physical attacks, Monsters have their own Defense Multiplier stat 
(referenced via a lookup table):

D.M. = Monster Defense Multiplier

5.3.1.2) SELF-TARGETTING
If the attacker is targeting a party member, then if the target is equipped 
with a shield:

D.M. = (Agility/16) + (Level/16) + 1 * (number of shields equipped)

If the party member target is not equipped with a shield:

D.M. = (Agility/32) + (Level/32)

5.3.2) DEFENSE MULTIPLIER PENALTIES

5.3.2.1) VULNERABLE TARGET
If the character is physically attacking their own party member who is in a 
vulnerable state:

D.M. = 0 

5.4) EVADE%

5.4.1) INITIAL VALUES OF EVADE%

5.4.1.1) MONSTER EVADE%
Against physical attacks, Monsters have their own Evade% (referenced via a 
lookup table):

Evade% = Monster Evade%

5.4.1.1) SELF-TARGETTING
If the attacker is targeting a party member:

Evade% = Sum of all worn (Armour Evade%) + (Agility/4)

5.5) NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER CALCALUTION
The following is just a theory, but it does fit with observed testing:

M = 0
FOR I = 1..A.M.
IF (1..100) <= Hit% 
M = M + 1

FOR I = 1..D.M.
IF (1..100) <= Evade%
M = M - 1

M is Net Attack Multiplier. If M <= 0 then the attack is a 'Miss'.

************************************************
6) MULTIPLY BASE DAMAGE BY NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
************************************************

Using Base Damage calculated from Steps 1-4, and Net Attack Multiplier (M) 
from Step 5:

Final Damage = Base Damage * M

*******************************************
7) APPLY FINAL DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
*******************************************

7.1) FINAL DAMAGE BONUSES

7.1.1) BUILDUP COMMAND
If a Karateka has executed one 'Buildup' command prior to the current attack, 
then:

Final Damage = Final Damage * 2

If a Karateka has executed two 'Buildup' commands prior to the current attack, 
then:

Final Damage = Final Damage * 3

Note that immediately after a Karateka executes a third 'Buildup' command 
without a 'Fight' command, then an 'Overload' occurs and the current attack is 
aborted and HP = (Current HP)/2

7.1.2) JUMP COMMAND
If a Dragoon is landing an attack from a 'Jump' command:

Final Damage = Final Damage * 3

7.2) MINIMUM DAMAGE
As long as M > 0, then Final Damage is always at least one:

IF (M > 0) and (Final Damage <= 0)
Final Damage = 1

7.3) STATUS ATTACKS
If the attacker's physical attack has a Status effect, then:

N = 0
FOR I = 1..M
IF (1..100) <= (Hit%-Evade%)
N = N + 1

The status will be inflicted on the target as long as N > 0.

****************
8) DUAL WIELDING
****************

If the attacker is wielding two weapons, apply Steps 1-7 for each hand.  Final 
Damage is the sum from each hand and the number of hits shown on screen is the 
sum of the Net Attack Multipliers from each hand:

Final Damage = Final Damage (from Right Hand) + Final Damage (from Left Hand)

M (displayed on screen) = M (from Right Hand) + M (from Left Hand)

Haste spell (via Steps 1-6).

Base Damage = Base Damage + (Final Damage calculated from Haste)

2.2) BASE DAMAGE MULTIPLICATIVE BONUSES

2.2.1) ELEMENTAL WEAKNESS
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is weak 
against at least one of those elements, then the target will be considered 
weak.  If the target is weak against the attacking element, then:

2.2.2) VULNERABLE TARGET
Vulnerable states include being a Frog, Mini, immediately after executing a 
'Buildup' command and just prior to a subsequent 'Fight' or 'Overload', and 
also during the entire round when the target or any of its party members 
attempt to Run or Escape. If the target of the attack is in a vulnerable 
state:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2 

2.3) BASE DAMAGE MULTIPLICATIVE PENALTIES

2.3.1) ELEMENTAL STRENGTH
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is strong 
against at least one of those elements and is not weak against any of those 
elements, then the target will be considered strong.  If the target is strong 
against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage / 2

Defense = Sum of all worn (Armour Defense) + (Vitality/2)

4.2) DEFENSE BONUSES

4.2.1) SAFE SPELL

equal to the calculated Final Damage from the caster's Safe spell (via Steps 
1-6).

Defense = Defense + (Final Damage calculated from Safe)

4.2.2) DEFEND COMMAND
Immediately after a target executes a 'Defend' command, he will receive a 
bonus against physical attacks.  This bonus only lasts until the end of the 
current round.

Defense = Defense * 4

4.3) DEFENSE PENALTIES

4.3.1) VULNERABLE TARGET
If the target of the attack is in a vulnerable state:

5.1.2) ATTACK MULTIPLIER BONUSES

5.1.2.1) HASTE SPELL
Attackers that have had Haste cast on them get an additive bonus for physical 
attacks.  This bonus is equal to the calculated Net Multiplier from the 
caster's Haste spell (via Step 5).  Note that A.M. has a maximum value of 16.  
If Haste is cast on a target that already has an A.M. of 16, then the spell

XI.  DAMAGE CALCULATION FORMULA:  MAGIC ATTACKS & ITEMS

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Monsters cast spells or use special attacks similar to the way characters cast 
spells.  The damage calculation formula is essentially same in either case.  
Also, a character that uses an item is essentially casting the spell that is 
associated with that item and again the damage calculation formula is similar.  
Two important differences with items are:

i)  Items have their own Magic Attack Multiplier.  This is not influenced by 
any of the attacker's stats.

ii)  Items have their Magic Hit% of 100. This is also not influenced by any of 
the attacker's stats, nor is it affected by Blind.

Finally, the Geomancer's 'Terrain' command is essentially the same as casting 
Black Magic, without using MP.

The following are detailed steps for calculating damage when a magic attack is 
made.  These steps are all cumulative, calculated in the following order:

************************
1) CALCULATE BASE DAMAGE
************************

1.1) BLACK MAGIC DAMAGE
Note that Black Magic also includes the Terrain command from the Geomancer.

Base Damage = Spell Damage + (Intellect/2)

1.2) WHITE MAGIC DAMAGE
For offensive White magic (Holy, Aero2, Aero):

Base Damage = Spell Damage + (Spirit/2)

For non-offensive White magic (Cure4, Cure3, Cure2, Cure, Haste, Safe):

Base Damage = Spell Damage

1.3) CALL MAGIC DAMAGE
For Call Magic:

Base Damage = Spell Damage + Intellect

******************************************
2) APPLY BASE DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
******************************************

2.1) BASE DAMAGE MULTIPLICATIVE BONUSES

against at least one of those elements, then the target will be considered 
weak.  If the target is weak against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2

2.1.2) TARGETS THAT ARE TOAD, MINI OR BUILDUP
If the target is a Frog, Mini or has executed a 'Buildup' command and not 
executed a subsequent 'Fight' or 'Overload', the attacker gets a bonus to Base 
Damage.  Note this does NOT apply for non-offensive White magic:

Base Damage = Base Damage * 2 (not for non-offensive White magic)

2.2) BASE DAMAGE MULTIPLICATIVE PENALTIES

2.2.1) ELEMENTAL STRENGTH
Note that for attacks with multiple elements, as long as the target is strong 
against at least one of those elements and is not weak against any of those 
elements, then the target will be considered strong.  If the target is strong 
against the attacking element, then:

Base Damage = Base Damage / 2

************************************
3) APPLY RANDOM RANGE TO BASE DAMAGE
************************************

Apply a random range to the Base Damage:

Base Damage = (Base Damage..Base Damage*1.5)

****************************
4) SUBTRACT TARGET'S DEFENSE
****************************

The target's magic defense value will reduce the Base Damage of the attack.

4.1) INITIAL DEFENSE VALUE

4.1.1) CHARACTER MAGIC DEFENSE

Defense = Sum of all (Armour Base Magic Defense) worn 

4.1.2) MONSTER MAGIC DEFENSE
Against magic attacks, Monsters have their own Magic Defense stat (referenced 
via a lookup table):

Defense = Monster Magic Defense

4.1.3) SELF-TARGETTING
If the attacker is targeting his own party member:

Defense = 0

4.2) DEFENSE BONUSES

4.2.1) SAFE SPELL
Targets that have had Safe cast on them get an additive bonus.  This bonus is 
equal to the calculated Final Damage from the caster's Safe spell (via Steps 
1-6).

Defense = Defense + (Final Damage calculated from Safe)

4.3) DEFENSE PENALTIES

4.3.1) TARGETS THAT ARE TOAD, MINI OR BUILDUP
If the target is a Frog, Mini or has executed a 'Buildup' command and not 
executed a subsequent 'Fight' or 'Overload', the target gets a penalty to 
Defense:

Defense = 0

4.4) BASE DAMAGE CALCULATION 
Subtract the target's Defense value from the attacker's base Damage:

Base Damage = Base Damage - Defense

**********************************
5) CALCULATE NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
**********************************

A.M. = Attack Multiplier
D.M. = Defense Multiplier
M = Net Attack Multiplier

5.1) ATTACK MULTIPLIER

5.1.1) BLACK MAGIC ATTACK MULTIPLIER
Note that Black Magic also includes the Terrain command from the Geomancer.

A.M. = (Intellect/16) + (Level/16) + (Skill/32) + 1

5.1.2) WHITE MAGIC ATTACK MULTIPLIER
For White magic:

A.M. = (Spirit/16) + (Level/16) + (Skill/32) + 1

5.1.3) CALL MAGIC ATTACK MULTIPLIER
For Call magic:

A.M. = (Intellect/8) + (((Skill/8)*3)/2) + 1

5.1.4) ITEM ATTACK MULTIPLIER
Items have their own attack multiplier that is not influenced by any of the 
character's stats.

A.M. = Item Attack Multiplier

5.2) HIT%

5.2.1) INITIAL VALUE OF HIT%

5.2.1.1) BLACK SPELL HIT%
Note that Black Magic also includes the Terrain command from the Geomancer.

Hit% = Spell Hit% + (Intellect/2)

5.2.1.2) WHITE SPELL HIT%
For White magic:

Hit% = Spell Hit% + (Spirit/2)

5.2.1.3) CALL SPELL HIT%
For Call Magic:

Hit% = Spell Hit% + Intellect

5.2.1.4) ITEM HIT%
All items have a Hit% of 100 that is not influenced by any of the character's 
stats.

Hit% = 100 (for items only)

5.2.2) HIT% BONUSES

5.2.2.1) TOAD OR MINI ON PARTY MEMBERS
Toad, Mini, Life and Life2 appear to have a Hit% of 100 when cast on party 
members:

Hit% = 100 (for Toad, Mini, Life and Life2 cast on party members)

5.2.3) HIT% PENALTIES

5.2.3.1) BLIND STATUS
Note that being Blind does not affect the Hit% of items.  If the attacker is 
Blind:

Hit% = Hit%/2 (not for items)

5.2.3.2) KILL SPELL
The success rate of the Kill spell also depends on the relative levels between 
the target and caster:

IF Target Level >= ((((Attacker Level)/2)*3)/2)
Hit% = 0

5.3) DEFENSE MULTIPLIER

5.3.1) INITIAL VALUE OF DEFENSE MULTIPLIER

5.3.1.1) CHARACTER MAGIC DEFENSE MULTIPLIER

D.M. = (Agility/32) + (Intellect/32) + (Spirit/32)

5.3.1.2) MONSTER MAGIC DEFENSE MULTIPLIER
Against magic attacks, Monsters have their own Base Magic Defense Multiplier 
(referenced via a lookup table):

D.M. = Monster Base Magic Defense Multiplier

5.3.2) DEFENSE MULTIPLIER PENALTIES

5.3.2.1) TOAD OR MINI
If the target of a magic attack is a Toad or Mini:

D.M. = 0

D.M. = 0 

5.4) EVADE%

5.4.1) INITIAL VALUES OF EVADE%

5.4.1.1) CHARACTER MAGIC EVADE%

Magic Evade% = (Intellect/2) + (Spirit/2)

5.4.1.2) MONSTER MAGIC EVADE%
Against magic attacks, Monsters have their own Magic Evade% (referenced via a 
lookup table):

Evade% = Monster Magic Evade%

5.5) NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER CALCALUTION
The following is just a theory, but it does fit with observed testing:

M = 0
FOR I = 1..A.M.
IF (1..100) <= Hit% 
M = M + 1

FOR I = 1..D.M.
IF (1..100) <= Evade%
M = M - 1

M is Net Attack Multiplier. If M <= 0 then the attack is 'Ineffective'.  For 
the
'Terrain' command, if M <= 0 against ALL targets, instead of 'Ineffective', 
then 'Backfired' occurs.  The attacker subsequently also sustains (MAX HP)/4 
damage.

************************************************
6) MULTIPLY BASE DAMAGE BY NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER

Using Base Damage calculated from Steps 1-4, and Net Attack Multiplier (M) 
from Step 5:

Final Damage = Base Damage * M

*******************************************
7) APPLY FINAL DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
*******************************************

7.1) FINAL DAMAGE BONUSES

7.1.1) CURE4
If Cure4 is cast on a single target, that target heals to full HP.  If Cure4 
is cast on multiple targets, follow all Steps in Damage Calculation normally.

7.2) FINAL DAMAGE PENALTIES

7.2.1) MULTIPLE TARGETS
If the attacker has selected multiple targets instead of single target, then:

Final Damage = (Final Damage)/(number of targets selected)

Note this does NOT apply to spells that automatically targets multiple targets 
(Quake, Meteo, Call Spells)

7.3) MINIMUM DAMAGE
As long as M > 0, then Final Damage is always at least one:

IF (M > 0) and (Final Damage <= 0)
Final Damage = 1

7.4) STATUS ATTACKS
If the attacking spell has a Status effect, then the status will be inflicted 
on the target as long as M > 0.

8) MULTIPLE TARGETS
*******************

If the attacker is attacking multiple targets, repeat Steps 1-7 for each 
target.

SKILL DATA

Every time a command is entered in battle, that character will receive a 
certain amount of Percentile Points, depending on its Job and the command that 
was entered.  Every 100 Percentile Points accumulated gives +1 to the 
character's current Job Skill.  Percentile Points over 100 are discarded after 
the battle.  Characters that are Dead or Petrified at the end of battle
receive no Percentile Points.  If the party successfully runs or escapes from
battle then no one receives any Percentile Points.  The following is a list of 
all Jobs and the amount of Percentile Points (%PTS) earned for each command:

*************
CRITICAL HITS
*************

I don't know how to manipulate the critical hit rate of Weapons or Monsters, 
so it is very difficult to figure out where and how much criticals affect the 
damage calculation formula. Casual observation has shown it to sometimes be 
double damage, and other times to be indistinguishable from the normal damage 
range. The final damage shown is not always a multiple of 2, so if anything, 
the damage bonus would probably be applied in Step 1 somewhere.

**********
STEAL RATE
**********

Steal rate is much harder to derive a formula for since there appears to only 
be a single success rate% to check. With Magic Hit%, attack multipliers made it 
easier to distinguish the observed data. With only a single check and the 
sometimes erratic behaviour of the pseudo-random number generator, it's hard 
to distinguish between a 66% success rate and a 75% success rate, or even a 
25% success and 50% success, unless I do > 300 trials. What I CAN say for sure 
is that:

i) Steal rate only depends on Skill and Level (NOT Agility). Target's Level 
also doesn't seem to have any effect.

ii) At Level 99 and Skill 99, Steal Rate is not 100%. It appears to be ~ 75% 
but could be 66%.

Best guess for the Steal Rate formula would be either:

Steal Rate% = (Level/3) + (Skill/3)

or 

Steal Rate% = (Level/2) + (Skill/4)
