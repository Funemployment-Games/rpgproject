1. Determine chance to hit:
     Chance to Hit = (BC + H)* - E
     BC = base chance to hit
     H = attacker hit percentage
     E = defender evade percentage
     --If the Target is Asleep or Paralyzed, Chance to Hit = BC
     
     The value in parenthesis is capped at 255 _before_ Evasion is subtracted

    
 2. Perform a hit roll
     A Hit Roll is done and a random number is selected from 0 to 200. 

     If that number is less than or equal to the Chance to Hit, the Hit connects. 0 is an
     automatic hit, and 200 is an automatic miss.

3. Resolve Damage
	 Damage = A...2A - D
     A = attack power
     D = target's defense
     --If the Target is weak to an Elemental or Enemy-Type attribute of the weapon,
     add +4 to A (this is bugged and doesn't work on the NES version)

Damage Formulas:
    Standard
	Attack = Weapon Attack + STR/2

	Armed BB/MA or BM/BW 
	Attack = Weapon Attack + STR/2 + 1

	Unarmed BB/MA
	Attack = Level*2

Defense Formulas:
	Standard
	Defense = Sum of Equipped Armor

	Unequipped* BB/MA
	Defense = Level

Attack Damage = (Weapon Damage) + (Strength/4)
Attack Multiplier = (Agility/16) + (Level/16) + 1
Hit%: Hit% = (Weapon Hit%) + (Agility/4) + (Skill/4)
Defense = sum of all worn (Armour Defense) + (Vitality/2)
(with shield):

Defense Multiplier = (Agility/16) + (Level/16) + 1 * (number of shields
                     equipped)

(without shield):

Defense Multiplier = (Agility/32) + (Level/32)
Evade% = sum of all worn (Armour Evade%) + (Agility/4)
Magic Defense = sum of all worn (Armour Magic Defense)
Magic Evade% = (Intellect/2) + (Spirit/2)

1) CALCULATE BASE DAMAGE
      Base Damage = Attack Damage = (Weapon Damage) + (Strength/4)

2) APPLY BASE DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
      Base Damage = (Base Damage + (additive bonuses)) * (multiplicative bonuses
                    or penalties)

3) APPLY RANDOM RANGE TO BASE DAMAGE
      Base Damage = (Base Damage..Base Damage*1.5)

4) SUBTRACT TARGET'S DEFENSE
      Base Damage = Base Damage - Defense

5) CALCULATE NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
      M (on average) ~= ((Attack Multiplier) * Hit%) - ((Defense Multiplier) *
                        Evade%)

6) MULTIPLY BASE DAMAGE BY NET ATTACK MULTIPLIER
      Final Damage = Base Damage * M

7) APPLY FINAL DAMAGE BONUSES AND PENALTIES
      Final Damage = Final Damage * (bonuses or penalties)

8) DUAL WIELDING OR MULTIPLE TARGETS
      Repeat Steps 1-7 for each weapon in each hand.
      Repeat Steps 1-7 for each target.

Step 1: Compute the Attacker's Base Attack Power
Step 2: Modify the Base Attack Power
Step 3: Compute the Attacker's Hit Rate aka Attack% or Precision
Step 4: Factor in the Hit Rate Modifiers
Step 5: Calculate the Attack Multiplier
Step 6: Calculate Target's Defense
Step 7: Factor in Defense Modifiers
Step 8: Calculate Evade AKA Defense%
Step 9: Apply Evade Modifiers
Step 10: Compute Defense Multiplier
Step 11: Modify the Attack Multiplier
Step 12: Plugging All The Numbers In...
Step 13: Inflicting Statuses

~~~~FF5~~~~
1) Determine initial Hit% and Evade% values.
2) Apply appropriate modifiers to Hit% and Evade%
3) Determine whether the attack hits or not.  
   If the attack misses, do not follow any more steps
4) If the Attack hits, get initial values for Attack, Defense and M, using the
   appropriate section in the Damage Parameters section.
5) Apply appropriate modifiers to Attack, Defense and M
6) Calculate Final Damage
6) Apply any appropriate Status Effects.

Hit Calculation
Step 1. Clear
Step 2. Death Protection
Step 3. Unblockable attacks
Step 4. Check to hit for normal attacks

Base Damage = Att + [(Att + Lvl) / 32] * [(Att * Lvl) / 32]

Step 1: Hit Determination

  Hit% = (AttackerLuck / 2 + AttackerHit - TargetEva - TargetLuck)

Step 2: Critical Determination

  Critical% = (AttackerLuck + 1) / 256 * 100

Step 3: Base Damage Calculation

  Damage = AttackerStr^2 / 16 + AttackerStr
  Damage = Damage * (265 - TargetVit) / 256
  Damage = Damage * Power / 16

  Note: A normal attack has a Power value of 20
